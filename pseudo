1) upload file
2) File is turned into an array (Or something) and passed. Ignore blank spaces?
3) Word count, ignore blank spaces
4) do conditions, use calc_percentage function
					1) searches words that match the first few letters
					within the corpus supplied
					2) # all matches found/ total words

Turn into a string and use regex.
					
Question is if I should use an array, or string or what

If it reads it as a string, will it count white space?





Doing percentages translation

Graph coordinates:

x: 0, 140, 280
y: 0, 71, 141

X = left most, center, right most
y= top most, center, bottom most


in alg
//x left- right+
//y lib - top +

In algorithms:
            x+1 = right
            x-1 = left
            y+1 = auth
            y-1 = lib

            x = positive = right
            x = negative = left
            y = negative = lib
            y = positive = auth

So the percentage will depend on if it is negative or positive

            The tree has a points system which it measures by word frequency. This means that
            I'd have to grep a word's frequency for each phrase instead of inspecting each word
            one by one. With percentage, I may have to make actual if statements for each
            instead of a bag words approach.
            
            How can I still have a bag of words approach ?
            
            overlap on words in three methods?
            root words?
            
            How am I going to integrate total words and turning it into percentage
            into this?
            
            
            
            
            What does stuff like this represent (0.0|13.0/1.0)
            Also stuff like "( wir > 0.79713)", what is it applying it
            to, the frequency it is seen in all the word of the document?
            
            It must be doing frequency based on total words, not how many times said.
            
            Can't have overlap in words checked.
            
            Should I:
                left vs right, top vs bottom
                or
                quadrant by quadrant
                
                Even the quadrant by quadrant seems to still keep x, y in mind

            Also in regards to x,y, it says plus or minus
            
            So in which direction is going
            
            Might want to just use the conditions supplied
            
            var word total
            var political word total
            
            
1 = ffax=ffax+1, ffay=ffay+1
2 = ffax=ffax-1, ffay=ffay+1
3 = ffax=ffax-1, ffay=ffay-1
4 = ffax=ffax+1, ffay=ffay-1

            1= right auth x+1, y+1
            2= left auth  x-1, y+1
            3= left lib   x-1, y-1
            4= right lib  x+1, y-1

            y+1 = auth
            y-1 = lib
            

            Do I want to be dealing with negatives here?
            
            
            
    What does x-n do?
    
    
    How am I going to get percentages out of every condition?
    
    total words
    
    ((Allwordsstartw_X)/total) > percentage
    
    I don't wanna add all these manually. There might be some regex
    
    I can make a function:
     if ( function(allwordsstartw_x, totalwords) > percentage
        
        
        function(wordsstart, total)
        {
         in_doc
        
        
        }
        
        
    I can ctrl replace > with , total)>
    then
    
    ctrl h, if( function(
