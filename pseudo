                //Then pick each word of the speech and see if they belong to any of
                //the bags. This is much easier than an if statement for each variable
                //because you can change the bag of words. so it'll either be:
                //
                //Left bag, right bag, top bag, bottom bag 
                //Or

          // Points system, and it needs to stay within the 100 percent range
          //How do I make sure it stays within the range?
          //Need to turn any number into a range of 1
          // But I'd also need a standard or extremity/non extremity
          //larger numbers matter
          //I guess use corpus size? That doesn't really put someone in place of extremity
          //I guess what matters is HOW far they are from the 0.
          
          //left and right:
            //if x = 0, then x = 145
            // if greater than/ less than:
                // + or - 145
            //top and down:
            //if y = 0, then y = 73

                // + or - 73
            
            
            //This will put people in a quadrant moreso than an actual place
            //Because the basis is whether they are in the center
            //SO, left words will cancel out right words
            //the more left, the less closer to zero.
            
            //What I could use is words that are picked up as political language in the file
            // variables in program:
            // left words

            The tree has a points system which it measures by word frequency. This means that
            I'd have to grep a word's frequency for each phrase instead of inspecting each word
            one by one. With percentage, I may have to make actual if statements for each
            instead of a bag words approach.
            
            How can I still have a bag of words approach ?
            
            overlap on words in three methods?
            root words?
            
            How am I going to integrate total words and turning it into percentage
            into this?
            
            
            
            
            What does stuff like this represent (0.0|13.0/1.0)
            Also stuff like "( wir > 0.79713)", what is it applying it
            to, the frequency it is seen in all the word of the document?
            
            It must be doing frequency based on total words, not how many times said.
            
            Can't have overlap in words checked.
            
            Should I:
                left vs right, top vs bottom
                or
                quadrant by quadrant
                
                Even the quadrant by quadrant seems to still keep x, y in mind

            Also in regards to x,y, it says plus or minus
            
            So in which direction is going
            
            Might want to just use the conditions supplied
            
            var word total
            var political word total
            
            
1 = ffax=ffax+1, ffay=ffay+1
2 = ffax=ffax-1, ffay=ffay+1
3 = ffax=ffax-1, ffay=ffay-1
4 = ffax=ffax+1, ffay=ffay-1

            1= right auth x+1, y+1
            2= left auth  x-1, y+1
            3= left lib   x-1, y-1
            4= right lib  x+1, y-1
            
            x+1 = right
            x-1 = left
            y+1 = auth
            y-1 = lib
            

            Do I want to be dealing with negatives here?
            
            
            
    What does x-n do?
    
    
    How am I going to get percentages out of every condition?
    
    total words
    
    ((Allwordsstartw_X)/total) > percentage
    
    I don't wanna add all these manually. There might be some regex
    
    I can make a function:
     if ( function(allwordsstartw_x, totalwords) > percentage
        
        
        function(wordsstart, total)
        {
         in_doc
        
        
        }
        
        
    I can ctrl replace > with , total)>
    then
    
    ctrl h, if( function(
