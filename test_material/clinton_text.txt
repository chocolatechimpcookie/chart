thank you to richard and thanks for the great work that the council does under your leadership it truly is an important resource for us all fareed i look forward to having the conversation with you everyone here at the council and mr mayor thank you very much for being here and for everything you are doing and will do to keep our city safe and strong i am very grateful

i wanted to come here to our city which has shown such resilience in the face of terrorism to talk about the events of the past week and the work we must do together to protect our country and our friends

when the united states was hit on 9/11 our allies treated that attack against one as an attack against all  now it is our turn to stand in solidarity with france and all of our friends we cherish the same values we face the same adversaries we must share the same determination

after a major terrorist attack every society faces a choice between fear and resolve the world great democracies can’t sacrifice our values or turn our backs on those in need therefore we must choose resolve and we must lead the world to meet this threat

now let us be clear about what we are facing

beyond paris in recent days we have seen deadly terrorist attacks in nigeria lebanon iraq and turkey and a russian civilian airliner destroyed over the sinai

at the heart of today new landscape of terror is isis they persecute religious and ethnic minorities kidnap and behead civilians murder children they systematically enslave torture and rape women and girls

isis operates across three mutually reinforcing dimensions a physical enclave in iraq and syria

an international terrorist network that includes affiliates across the region and beyond and an ideological movement of radical jihadism we have to target and defeat all three

and time is of the essence isis is demonstrating new ambition reach and capabilities we have to break the group momentum and then its back our goal is not to deter or contain isis but to defeat and destroy isis

but we have learned that we can score victories over terrorist leaders and networks only to face metastasizing threats down the road so we also have to play and win the long game

we should pursue a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy – one that embeds our mission against isis within a broader struggle against radical jihadism that is bigger than any one group whether it al qaeda or isis or some other network an immediate war against an urgent enemy and a generational struggle against an ideology with deep roots will not be easily be torn outit will require sustained commitment and every pillar of american power this is a worldwide fight – and america must lead it

our strategy should have three main elements one defeat isis in syria iraq and across the middle east two disrupt and dismantle the growing terrorist infrastructure that facilitates the flow of fighters financing arms and propaganda around the world three harden our defenses and those of our allies against external and homegrown threats

let me start with the campaign to defeat isis across the region the united states and our international coalition have been conducting this fight for more than a year it is time to begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts to smash the would-be caliphate and deny isis control of territory in iraq and syria that starts with a more effective coalition air campaign with more allied planes more strikes and a broader target set a key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about isis and its operations

so we need an immediate intelligence surge73 in the region including technical assets arabic speakers with deep expertise in the middle east and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with al qaeda in the past  this would help us identify and eliminate isis command and control and its economic lifelines a more effective coalition air campaign is necessary but not sufficient and we should be honest about the fact that to be successful air strikes will have to be combined with ground forces actually taking back more territory from isis

like president obama i do not believe that we should again have a hundred thousand american troops in combat in the middle east that is just not the smart move to make here if we have learned anything from 15 years of war in iraq and afghanistan it is that local people and nations have to secure their own communities we can help them and we should but we cannot substitute for them

but we can and should support local and regional ground forces in carrying out this mission now the obstacles to achieving this are significant

on the iraqi side of the border kurdish forces have fought bravely to defend their own lands and to retake towns from isis but the iraqi national army has struggled it is going to take more work to get it up to fighting shape as part of that process we may have to give our own troops advising and training the iraqis greater freedom of movement and flexibility including embedding in local units and helping target airstrikes

ultimately however the ground campaign in iraq will only succeed if more iraqi sunnis join the fight but that will not happen so long as they do not feel they have a stake in their country or confidence in their own security and capacity to confront isis

now we have been in a similar place before in iraq in the first sunni awakening in 2007 we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out al qaeda unfortunately under prime minister maliki rule those tribes were betrayed and forgotten so the task of bringing sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult but nonetheless we need to lay the foundation for a second sunni awakening

we need to put sustained pressure on the government in baghdad to get its political house in order move forward with national reconciliation and finally stand up a national guard baghdad needs to accept – even embrace – arming sunni and kurdish forces in the war against isis but if baghdad will not do that the coalition should do so directly

on the syrian side the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage isis – beyond the syrian kurds who are already deep in the fight – is that the viable sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting assad who let us remember has killed many more syrians than the terrorists have but they are increasingly seeing the threat from isis as well

so we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership and to encourage more syrians to take on isis as well  to support them we should immediately deploy the special operations force president obama has already authorized and be prepared to deploy more as more syrians get into the fight and we should retool and ramp up our efforts to support and equip viable syrian opposition units

our increased support should go hand-in-hand with increased support from our arab and european partners including special forces who can contribute to the fight on the ground we should also work with the coalition and the neighbors to impose no fly zones that will stop assad from slaughtering civilians and the opposition from the air opposition forces on the ground with material support from the coalition could then help create safe areas where syrians could remain in the country rather than fleeing toward europe this combined approach would help enable the opposition to retake the remaining stretch of the turkish border from isis choking off its supply lines it would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that secretary kerry is pursuing

of course we have been down plenty of diplomatic dead-ends before in this conflict  but we have models for how seemingly intractable multi-sectarian civil wars do eventually end we can learn lessons from lebanon and bosnia about what it will take and russia and iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability right now i am afraid president putin is actually making things somewhat worse

now to be clear though there is a role for russia to help for resolving the conflict in syria and we have indicated a willingness to work with them toward an outcome that preserves syria as a unitary non-sectarian state with protections of the rights of all syrians and to keep key state institutions in tact there is no alternative to a political transition that allows syrians to end assad rule now much of this strategy on both sides of the border hinges on the roles of our arab and turkish partners and we must get them to carry their share of the burden with military intelligence and financial contributions as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in iraq and syria

countries like jordan have offered more and we should take them up on it  because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the arabs and turks step up in a much bigger way this is their fight and they need to act like itso far however turkey has been more focused on the kurds than on countering isis and to be fair turkey has a long and painful history with kurdish terrorist groups but the threat from isis cannot wait

as difficult as it may be we need to get turkey to stop bombing kurdish fighters in syria who are battling isis and become a full partner our coalition efforts against isis the united states should also work with our arab partners to get them more invested in the fight against isis

at the moment they are focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region especially the threat from iran that is why the saudis for example shifted attention from syria to yemen so we have to work out a common approach

in september i laid out a comprehensive plan to counter iranian influence across the region and its support for terrorist proxies such as hezbollah and hamas we cannot view iran and isis as separate challenges  regional politics are too interwoven raising the confidence of our arab partners and raising the costs to iran for bad behavior will contribute to a more effective fight against isis

and as we work out a broader regional approach we should of course be closely consulting with israel our strongest ally in the middle east israel increasingly shares with our arab partners and has the opportunity to do more in intelligence and in joint efforts as well

we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is we have to fit a lot of pieces together bring a lot of partners along move on multiple fronts at once  but if we press forward on both sides of the border in the air and on the ground as well as diplomatically i do believe we can crush isis enclave of terror

and to support this campaign congress should swiftly pass an updated authorization to use military force that will send a message to friend and foe alike that the united states is committed to this fight the time for delay is over  we should get this done

now the second element of our strategy looks beyond the immediate battlefield of iraq and syria to disrupt and dismantle global terrorist infrastructure on the ground and online a terror pipeline that facilitates the flow of fighters financing arms and propaganda around the world has allowed isis to strike at the heart of paris last week and allowed al qaeda affiliate to do the same at charlie hebdo earlier this year

isis is working hard to extend its reach establishing affiliates and cells far from its home base   and despite significant setbacks it has encountered not just with isis and its ambitious plans but even al qaeda including the death of osama bin laden they are still posing rape threats to so many let take one example we have had a lot of conversation about isis in the last week let not forget al qaeda they still have the most sophisticated bomb-makers ambitious plotters and active affiliates in places like yemen and north africa

so we can’t just focus on iraq and syria – we need to intensify our counterterrorism efforts across a wider scope most urgent is stopping the flow of foreign fighters to and from the war zones of the middle east thousands thousands of young recruits have flocked to syria from france germany belgium the united kingdom and yes even the united states their western passports make it easier for them to cross borders and eventually return home radicalized and battle-hardened

stemming this tide will require much better coordination and information sharing among countries every step of the way we should not stop pressing until turkey where most foreign fighters cross into syria finally locks down its border  the united states and our allies need to know and share the identities of every fighter who has traveled to syria

we also have to be smart and target interventions that will have the greatest impact for example we need a greater focus on shutting down key enablers who arrange transportation documents and more when it comes to terrorist financing we have to go after the nodes that facilitate illicit trade and transactions

the un security council should update its terrorism sanctions they have a resolution that does try to block terrorist financing and other enabling activities but we have to place more obligation on countries to police their own banks and the united states which has quite a record of success in this area can share more intelligence to help other countries

and once and for all the saudis the qataris and others need to stop their citizens from directly funding extremist organizations as well as schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path toward radicalization when it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment we have to identify the hotspots – the specific neighborhoods and villages the prisons and schools – where recruitment happens in clusters like the neighborhood in brussels where the paris attacks were planned through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society – especially muslim community leaders – we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots

radicalization and recruitment also is happening online and there is no doubt we have to do a better job contesting online space including websites and chat rooms where jihadists communicate with followers we must deny them virtual territory just as we deny them actual territory

at the state department i built up a unit of communications specialists fluent in urdu arabic somali and other languages to do battle with extremists online we need more of that including from the private sector

social media companies can also do their part by swiftly shutting down terrorist accounts so they are not used to plan provoke or celebrate violence

online or offline the bottom line is that we are in a contest of ideas against an ideology of hate – and we have to win it

now let be clear though islam itself is not our adversary muslims are peaceful and tolerant people and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism

the obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilizations73 or repeating the specific words radical islamic terrorism73 is not just a distraction it gives these criminals these murderers more standing than they deserve and it actually plays into their hands by alienating partners we need by our side our priority should be how to fight the enemy

in the end it didn’t matter what kind of terrorist we called bin laden it mattered that we killed bin laden but we still can’t close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous strain of extremism within the muslim world that continues to spread its adherents are relatively few in number but capable of causing profound damage – most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from north and west africa to asia

overlapping conflicts collapsing state structures widespread corruption poverty and repression have created openings for extremists to exploit before the arab spring i warned that the region foundations would sink into the sand73 without immediate reforms well the need has only grown more urgent

we have to join with our partners to do the patient steady work of empowering moderates and marginalizing extremists supporting democratic institutions and the rule of law creating economic growth that supports stability working to curb corruption helping train effective and accountable local intelligence law enforcement and counterterrorism services

as we do this we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more effective and adaptable than the terror networks we’re trying to defeat when i became secretary of state i was surprised to find that nearly a decade after 9/11 there was still no dedicated international vehicle to regularly convene key countries to deal with terrorist threats

so we created the global counterterrorism forum which now brings together nearly 30 countries many from the muslim world it should be a clearinghouse for directing assistance to countries that need it for mobilizing common action against threats

and let not lose sight of the global cooperation needed to lock down loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons – and keep them out of the hands of terrorists

at the end of the day we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal that includes targeted strikes by us military aircraft and drones with proper safeguards when there aren’t any other viable options to deal with continuing imminent threats all of this – stopping foreign fighters blocking terrorist financing doing battle in cyberspace – is vital to the war against isis but it is also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that

now the third element of our strategy has to be hardening our defenses at home and helping our partners do the same against both external and homegrown threats

after 9/11 the united states made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe

we still have work to do on this front but by comparison europe is way behind

today european nations do not even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border or when a passport is stolen it seems like after most terrorist attacks we find out that the perpetrators were known to some security service or another but too often the dots never get connected i appreciate how hard this is especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats but this has to change the united states must work with europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination

european countries also should have the flexibility to enhance their border controls when circumstances warrant and here at home we face a number of our own challenges

the threat to airline security is evolving as terrorists develop new devices like non-metallic bombs so our defenses have to stay at least one step ahead we know that intelligence gathered and shared by local law enforcement officers is absolutely critical to breaking up plots and preventing attacks so they need all the resources and support we can give them

law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities including in our own country muslim-americans this should go without saying but in the current climate it bears repeating muslim americans are working every day on the frontlines of the fight against radicalization

another challenge is how to strike the right balance of protecting privacy and security encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem we should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously they have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack

on the other hand we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion network security and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit so we need silicon valley not to view government as its adversary we need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy now is the time to solve this problem not after the next attack

since paris no homeland security challenge is being more hotly debated than how to handle syrian refugees seeking safety in the united states

our highest priority of course must always be protecting the american people

so yes we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from syria guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners

and congress needs to make sure the necessary resources are provided for comprehensive background checks drawing on the best intelligence we can get and we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in visa programs as well but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and humanitarian obligations

turning away orphans applying a religious test discriminating against muslims slamming the door on every single syrian refugee – that is just not who we are we are better than that

and remember many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us

it would be a cruel irony indeed if isis can force families from their homes and then also prevent them from ever finding new ones we should be doing more to ease this humanitarian crisis not less we should lead the international community in organizing a donor conference and supporting countries like jordan who are sheltering the majority of refugees fleeing syria

and we can get this right  america open free tolerant society is described by some as a vulnerability in the struggle against terrorism but i actually believe it is one of our greatest strengths  it reduces the appeal of radicalism and enhances the richness and resilience of our communities

this is not a time for scoring political points when new york was attacked on 9/11 we had a republican president a republican governor and a republican mayor and i worked with all of them we pulled together and put partisanship aside to rebuild our city and protect our country this is a time for american leadership

no other country can rally the world to defeat isis and win the generational struggle against radical jihadism only the united states can mobilize common action on a global scale

and that is exactly what we need the entire world must be part of this fight but we must lead it

there been a lot of talk lately about coalitions everyone seems to want one  but there is not nearly as much talk about what it actually takes to make a coalition work in the heat and pressure of an international crisis

i know how hard this is because we have done it before–to impose the toughest sanctions in history on iran  to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in libya to support a fledgling democracy in afghanistan

we have to use every pillar of american power – military might but also diplomacy development aid economic and cultural influence technology and the force of our values that is smart power

you have to work with institutions and partners like nato the eu the arab league and the un  strengthen alliances and never get tired of old-fashioned shoe-leather diplomacy

and if necessary be prepared to act decisively on our own just as we did to bring osama bin laden to justice the united states and our allies must demonstrate that free people and free markets are still the hope of humanity

this past week as i watched the tragic scenes from france i kept thinking back to a young man the world met in january after the last attack in paris his name was lassana a muslim immigrant from mali who worked at a kosher market he said the market had become a new home and his colleagues and customers a second family73

when the terrorist arrived and the gunfire began lassana risked his life to protect his jewish customers he moved quickly hiding as many people as he could in the cold storage room and then slipping out to help the police

i didn’t know or care73 he said if they were jews or christians or muslims we are all in the same boat73

what a rebuke to the extremists’ hatred

the french government announced it would grant lassana full citizenship but when it mattered most he proved he was a citizen already

that is the power of free people that is what the jihadis will never understand and never defeat

and as we meet here today let us resolve that we will go forward together and we will do all we can to lead the world against this threat that threatens people everywhere thank you all73

thank you so very much  thank you  thanks for the great tour which i really appreciated having the chance to look around this impressive building and learning about everything that is being done here  the dart central station a leed platinum certified building  that the highest rating available and so everyone who contributed to that i really applaud
 
as elizabeth was saying the numbers are impressive a quarter of the construction materials were recycled  more than a million gallons of rainwater have been cleaned and reused leading to big savings in water consumption  rooftop solar panels have reduced carbon emissions and saved money  78 geothermal wells were dug and are now producing the energy for heating and cooling
 
there is just so much to admire in this building and what it stands for and it the kind of innovation and progress we want to see all over america 
 
it good for our economy good for the health of our families and communities and yes good for our planet
 
now i know there are still people who would rather not hear this  some deny climate change exists at all  others throw up their hands and say sorry i’m not a scientist73 
 
well i’m not a scientist either  that why i think it important to listen to scientists  it important to heed the warnings based on extensive scientific research to see what going on here in our own country and certainly around the world
 
the reality of climate change is unforgiving—no matter what the deniers say    sea levels are rising  ice caps are melting  storms wildfires and extreme weather are wreaking havoc
 
this is one of the most urgent threats of our time and we have no choice but to rise and meet it
 
now just as this challenge is enormous so are the opportunities it presents
 
here in iowa you’ve already moved past the old false choices between protecting our environment and growing the economy  instead you are thriving by doing both 
 
iowa is leading the nation in wind energy  this year for the first time iowa is producing roughly a third of your total electricity from renewables   and as i like to say as i travel around the country if iowa can do it so can the rest of the country  look to iowa to see how this can work
 
with leadership from president obama and the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and innovators across our country we are on our way to a clean energy future 
 
we’re showing the world there is no challenge too great for america to tackle 
 
but we have to do even more  and we need to do it now  so on day one as president i will set two ambitious national goals for renewable energy
 
first we need to have more than half a billion solar panels installed across the country by the end of my first term
 
second we’ll set a 10-year goal of generating enough renewable energy to power every single home in america
 
not some homes  not most homes  every home in america
 
now i know these goals will test our capacities but i know they are within our reach
 
and we’re all going to have to do our part  but that who we are as americans  we don’t hide from change we harness it
 
and over the next few months i will lay out a comprehensive agenda for meeting these national goals and going even further to address the broader climate challenge 
 
we will make america the world clean energy superpower 
 
we will develop and deploy the clean energy technologies of the future  transform our grid to give americans more control over the energy they produce and consume  and yes i will defend president obama clean power plant—clean power plan against attacks from republicans and their corporate backers
 
we’ll launch a clean energy challenge that supports and partners with states cities and rural communities that are ready to lead on clean energy
 
we’ll stop the giveaways to big oil companies and extend instead tax incentives for clean energy while making them more cost-effective for both taxpayers and producers
 
we’ll support—and improve—the renewable fuel standard that has been such a success for iowa and much of rural america
 
and even as we face the threat of climate change head on we cannot close our eyes to the challenges facing hard-working families in coal country who kept our lights on and our factories running for more than a century  we should guarantee that coal miners and their families get the benefits they’ve earned and the respect they deserve
 
we also have to mobilize an unprecedented global commitment to reduce carbon emissions around the world  and i know firsthand from my time as secretary of state that america ability to lead the world on this issue hinges on our commitment to act ourselves  no country will fall in line just because we tell them to  they need to see us taking significant steps of our own
 
the decisions we make in the next decade can make all of this possible or they can keep us trapped in the past 
 
i refuse to turn my back on what is one of the greatest threats and greatest opportunities america faces  i refuse to let those who are deniers who disagree with what we need to do to rip away all the progress we’ve made and leave our country exposed to the most severe consequences of climate change  america needs to lead this fight not go mia
 
that why i’m announcing these goals today  it why over the course of this campaign i’m going to keep this challenge front and center  and it why as president i’ll do everything i can to lead us toward that clean energy future and to work with partners in the state and local level who are doing exactly what we see here in this station and what is being done across iowa   that the kind of positive partnership that i think we need to have and that i will promote and make possible as president
 
now i’m happy to answer some questions73

in first pillar of comprehensive climate change platform clinton states ambitious goals for boosting renewable power production

today in a new video released by her campaign hillary clinton announced the first pillars of her comprehensive climate change agenda by setting two ambitious goals for boosting clean energy production in the us first she pledged that the united states will have more than half a billion solar panels installed across the country by the end of her first term second she promised to put policies in place to ensure that the united states will generate enough clean renewable energy to power every home in america within ten years of her taking office as president
 
the two goals comprise the first pillars of a comprehensive energy and climate agenda that she will lay out over the coming months she will discuss her plans for boosting clean energy production in further detail on monday after touring the leed platinum certified des moines area regional transit dart central station in iowa
 
we’re all going to have to do our part but that who we are as americans we don’t hide from change we harness it73 clinton says in the video we’re on the cusp of a new era we can have more choice in the energy we consume and produce we can create a more open efficient and resilient grid that connects us empowers us—improves our health and benefits us all the decisions we make in the next decade can make all of this possible or they can keep us trapped in the past  we cannot wait any longer it time we stand for a healthier climate stand for cleaner air for science innovation for our children for reality for the future73
 
by achieving clinton two goals the us will expand the amount of installed solar capacity to 140 gigawatts by the end of 2020 a 700 percent increase from current levels that is the equivalent of having rooftop solar systems on over 25 million homes the us will generate at least one third of all electricity from renewable sources and add more power generation capacity to the grid than during any decade in american history from a combination of wind solar hydro geothermal and other forms of renewable electricity as well as prevent thousands of premature deaths and tens of thousands of asthma attacks each year meet our national and international climate targets and move our economy along a path towards deep decarbonization by 2050
 
to achieve these goals clinton will launch a clean energy challenge that forms a new partnership with states cities and rural communities that are ready to lead on clean energy this challenge will include competitive grants and other market-based incentives to empower states to exceed federal carbon pollution standards and accelerate clean energy deployment awards for communities that successfully cut the red tape that slows rooftop solar installation times and increases costs for businesses and consumers work with states cities and rural communities to strengthen grid reliability and resilience increase consumer choice and improve customer value and expand the rural utilities service and other successful usda programs to help provide clean reliable and affordable energy not just to rural americans but to the rest of the country as well she also will fight efforts to roll back the clean power plan which is a crucial tool in our national strategy to reduce carbon pollution level the playing field for and increase the deployment of renewable energy and build a clean energy future
 
for more information on the goals clinton laid out in her video and how she believes the us can achieve them read the fact sheet on the briefing here
 
below is a transcript of hillary clinton voiceover in the video
 
future generations will look back and wonder what were we thinking73 
 
i’m just a grandmother with two eyes and a brain and i know what happening in the world is going to have a big effect on my daughter and especially on my granddaughter 
 
it hard to believe there are people running for president who still refuse to accept the settled science of climate change who would rather remind us they’re not scientists than listen to those who are 
 
you don’t have to be a scientist to take on this urgent challenge that threatens us all you just have to be willing to act  
 
america has made a start in addressing this threat 
 
the renewable energy industry already prevents as many as 70000 asthma attacks and 3000 premature deaths each year 
 
it created over 50000 new jobs and drove more than 35 billion dollars in investment last year alone 
 
but we have to do much more and we have to do it now 
 
on day one as president i will set two ambitious national goals that will test our capacities but that i know are within our reach 
 
first i will ensure we hit a target of having more that half a billion solar panels installed across the country by the end of my first term 
 
second we’ll set a 10-year goal of generating enough renewable energy to power every single home in america
 
over the next few months i will lay out a comprehensive agenda to meet the climate challenge and make america the world clean energy superpower 
 
we’re all going to have to do our part but that who we are as americans we don’t hide from change we harness it 
 
we’re on the cusp of a new era we can have more choice in the energy we consume and produce we can create a more open efficient and resilient grid that connects us empowers us—improves our health and benefits us all 
 
the decisions we make in the next decade can make all of this possible or they can keep us trapped in the past  we cannot wait any longer it time we stand for a healthier climate stand for cleaner air for science innovation for our children for reality for the future



thank you thank you hi hi thank you all very much thank you thank you thank you thank you very very much i want to tell you it wonderful being back here at nyu and i thank you all for joining me today especially my good friend and former colleague congresswoman carolyn maloney thank you so much carolyn for coming  i am grateful for this opportunity to share some of my further thoughts about our economy and the work that our country needs to do in the years ahead
 
first i want to say a word about what in the news today it because there have been a lot of inaccuracies as congressman cummings made clear this morning maybe the heat is getting to everybody  we all have a responsibility to get this right  i have released 55000 pages of emails i have said repeatedly that i will answer questions before the house committee  we are all accountable to the american people to get the facts right and i will do my part  but i’m also going to stay focused on the issues particularly the big issues that really matter to american families
 
over the past few months i’ve had the pleasure of meeting young people all over our country many came of age in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the deep recession that it caused  the fallout from that crash has tempered their expectations for the future and left them clear-eyed about the challenges ahead – the challenges they face and that america faces
 
yet like generations of americans before them there is also undimmed optimism
 
today young people are preparing to enter an economy they know will be competitive not just at home but globally  they’re thinking about how they’ll find a good job after graduation that can help them get ahead and stay ahead  the risk of a setback or potentially another crisis is never far from their minds  but what inspires me is that they are undaunted by these challenges  they’re seeking real opportunities and real rewards for the work that they put in  and they’re hopeful that tomorrow will indeed be better than today
 
i hear these stories everywhere i go  the hard work grit and sacrifices of people across our country that have brought us back and driven our recovery  so yes now we’re standing again but we’re not yet running the way america should
 
no country is better positioned to thrive in today global economy  we have the most innovative enterprising private sector and most talented workers anywhere in the world
 
yet while corporate profits are at near-record highs paychecks for most people have barely budged in real terms
 
and out-of-pocket costs of everything from health care to prescription drugs to childcare to college to caring for aging parents are all rising a lot faster than wages  that then is putting a lot of pressure enormous pressure on families and their budgets
 
my mission from my first day as president to the last will be to raise the incomes of hard-working americans— so they can once again afford a middle-class life  we need to end the wage stagnation that holding back our families and holding back our country
 
this is the defining economic challenge not only of this election but of our time  it gets to the core of who we are as a nation – the basic bargain of america
 
if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead  and when you get ahead our country gets ahead too
 
last week at the new school i laid out a broad economic agenda to raise incomes and build an economy that works for everyone not just those already at the top  it an agenda for strong growth fair growth and long-term growth
 
in the days ahead i will continue outlining plans in all these areas from setting ambitious goals for new infrastructure and clean energy investments to reining in excessive risk on wall street
 
today i want to focus in particular on long-term growth
 
consider this fact
 
a survey of corporate executives found that more than half would hold off making a successful long-term investment if it meant missing a target in the next quarterly earnings report
 
in another recent survey more than 60 percent said the pressure to provide short-term returns had increased over the previous five years
 
we also know that publicly-held companies facing pressure from shareholders are less likely to invest in growth opportunities than their privately-held counterparts
 
large public companies now return eight or nine out of every ten dollars they earn directly back to shareholders either in the form of dividends or stock buybacks which can temporarily boost share prices  last year the total reached a record $900 billion
that doesn’t leave much money to build a new factory or a research lab or to train workers or to give them a raise
 
in fact according to the wall street journal between 2003 and 2013 while typical companies in the s73p 500 doubled the share of cash flow they spent on dividends and stock buybacks they actually cut capital expenditures on things like new plants and equipment
 
as the founder of the investment management company vanguard put it a culture of short-term speculation has run rampant73
 
one other concerned business leader calls it quarterly capitalism73
 
now i understand that most ceos are simply responding to very real pressures from shareholders and the market to turn in good quarterly numbers  and investors are always looking for strong reliable returns
 
but it is clear that the system is out of balance – the deck is stacked in too many ways – and powerful pressures and incentives are pushing it even further out of balance
 
quarterly capitalism as developed over recent decades is neither legally required nor economically sound  it bad for business bad for wages and bad for our economy
 
and fixing it will be good for everyone
 
an increasing number of business leaders investors and academics are mobilizing to change the culture of boardrooms classrooms and trading floors and to better align incentives for long-term growth for the sake of our economy and our country we need to stand with them
 
innovators like google and spacex are investing in research that does little for today bottom line but may yield transformational benefits down the line
 
venture capitalists are patiently nurturing the next disruptive innovator
 
the big three automakers – gm ford and chrysler – are putting the memory of the crisis behind them and making new investments in factories and technologies of the future including advanced batteries
 
companies like trader joe and quiktrip that have prospered by investing in workers increasing wages and improving training are becoming industry models
 
and large employers like target and starbucks have recently raised wages for entry-level workers – and thanks to pressure from workers the trend has even extended to mcdonald and walmart
 
now you may have heard that i am a fan of chipotle and it not just because of their burrito bowl  last month the company announced it would provide paid sick days paid vacation time and tuition reimbursements to its part-time employees
 
these are all smart long-term investments that will and do pay off for companies workers and our society
 
and they point to an important question for the future of our economy how do we define shareholder value in the 21st century
 
is it maximizing immediate returns or delivering long-term growth  of course we want to do both  but today too often the former comes at the expense of the latter
 
real value is lasting value  we all know that in our own lives  i learned it watching my father sweat over the printing table in his small fabric shop in chicago  he scrimped and saved to build that business and provide for our family future
 
it wasn’t good enough to be secure for today  what mattered was tomorrow
 
and what true in life is also true in business  real value comes from long-term growth not short-term profits  it comes from building companies not stripping them from creating good jobs not eliminating them from seeing workers as assets to cultivate not costs to be cut
 
american business needs to break free from the tyranny of today earning report so they can do what they do best innovate invest and build tomorrow prosperity
 
it time to start measuring value in terms of years or the next decade not just the next quarter
 
that is one of the ways we can raise incomes help families get ahead and deliver real value for shareholders
 
now there no single cause of quarterly capitalism and therefore no single solution   but there are smart specific reforms that can be made by both the private and the public sectors that would better align market incentives for long-term growth reforms that many forward thinking business leaders themselves have been calling for
 
i’ll mention five areas of focus today but this list should be the beginning of the discussion not the end
 
first i am proposing a reform of taxes on capital gains – the profits earned by the sale of stock and other assets – to promote and reward farsighted investments
 
the current definition of a long-term holding period – just one year -- is woefully inadequate  that may count as long term73 for my baby granddaughter but not for the american economy  it no way to run a tax system
 
so as president i would move to a six-year sliding scale that provides real incentives for long-term investments
 
for taxpayers in the top bracket – families earning more than $465000 a year – any gains from selling stock in the first two years would be taxed just like ordinary income  then the rate would decrease each year until it returns to the current rate
 
this means that from the moment investors buy into a company they’ll be more focused on its future growth strategy than its immediate profits – and so will some executives who are paid in part with stock or stock options
 
i will also be looking at ways to address very short-term trading whether it conducted over days hours or even milliseconds
 
and we should offer the chance to eliminate capital gains taxes altogether for certain long-term investments in small businesses including innovative start-ups and hard-hit communities from inner-cities to the rust belt to coal country to indian country  this should go hand-in-hand with a revitalized and expanded new market tax credit which also encourages investment in poor or remote communities and helps prevent downward spirals after economic disruptions like plant closings or layoffs
 
i want to see more investors helping unlock the potential of the family business that struggling to get back on its feet  or the start-up that on the verge of making it big  or the community that lost the factory where generations of families worked but now is eager to build a new future  that long-term growth at its best
 
now of course i understand that these changes to the tax code alone will not shift investors’ focus from short-term to long-term overnight
but i believe this reform is an important first step toward removing some of the incentives that push us toward quarterly capitalism
 
and this will all be part of a broader reform of both individual and corporate taxes that i will be discussing later in the campaign  last week i called for closing the carried interest loophole and implementing the buffett rule which would make sure millionaires don’t pay lower rates than their secretaries
 
and in the months ahead i’ll address other inequities and loopholes that distort business decisions and rig our tax code for those at the top
 
the second area where action is needed is to address the influence of increasingly assertive shareholders determined to extract maximum profit in the minimum amount of time— even at the expense of future growth
 
now so-called activist shareholders73 can have a positive influence on companies  it a good thing when investors put pressure on management to stay nimble and accountable or press for social and environmental progress
 
but that very different from these hit and run73 activists whose goal is to force an immediate pay out – no matter how much it discourages and distracts management from pursuing strategies that would add the most long-term value for the company
 
even iconic businesses like apple or procter 73 gamble or dow chemical have felt this pressure
 
so we need a new generation of committed long-term investors to provide a counter-weight to the hit-and-run activists
 
now some institutional investors already are beginning to push back  we need more pension funds and proxy advisory firms to do so as well  institutional investors control 70 percent of the shares in the largest 1000 us companies  they have unmatched influence and therefore an unmatched obligation to guide companies toward strategies and metrics focused on long-term value
 
there are things government should do as well
 
as president i would order a full review of regulations on shareholder activism some of which haven’t been reexamined in decades let alone modernized to reflect changing realities in our economy
 
we also have to take a hard look at stock buybacks  investors and regulators alike need more information about these transactions  capital markets work best when information is promptly and widely available to all
 
other advanced economies – like the united kingdom and hong kong – require companies to disclose stock buybacks within one day  but here in the united states you can go an entire quarter without disclosing  so let change that
 
and buybacks lead directly to the third area of focus reforming executive compensation
 
we cannot address the challenge of quarterly capitalism without making sure that incentives for ceos and other executives are more focused on the long-term growth and strength of the companies they run and less on the short-term fluctuations in its share price
 
now i am all for rewarding ceos well when their companies prosper and their employees also share in the rewards  but there is something wrong when senior executives get rich while companies stutter and employees struggle  there something wrong when corporate boards allow exorbitant pay packages that aren’t based on credible assessments of executive performance or a company long-term interests
 
thirty years ago top ceo made 50 times what a typical worker did  today they make 300 times more  that just doesn’t make sense previous generations of executives were just as talented and hard-working and they managed to get by with much more reasonable compensation  so have ceos in other countries  it would be good for our economy and for our country if we get back to compensating all employees when productivity and profits increase not just those at the top
 
now in the 1990s there was an effort to tie executive compensation to company performance including through the use of stock options
 
but many stock-heavy pay packages have created a perverse incentive for executives to seek the big payouts that could come from a temporary rise in share price  and we ended up encouraging some of the same short-term thinking we meant to discourage
 
in addition while the dodd-frank financial reform legislation passed in 2010 called for new regulations regarding disclosure of executive compensation many rules have yet to be put in place
 
that includes a requirement to publish the ratio between ceo pay and the paychecks of everyday employees  there is no excuse for taking five years to get this done  workers have a right to know whether executive pay at their company has gotten out of balance – and so does the public
 
now we need to take several steps here
 
defend the dodd-frank act from republican attacks and finally get the promised rules on the books
 
reform the performance-based tax deductions for top executives
 
expand disclosure requirements under the say-on-pay73 rule to include an explanation of how executive compensation will promote the long-term health of the company
 
now a crucial fourth area for reform is how we empower workers and make sure they’re seen as the engines of growth that they are
 
research shows that well-paid and well-trained employees tend to work more efficiently stay on the job longer and provide better customer service  but those rewards can be harder to measure than the immediate cost of payroll and training so under the pressure of quarterly capitalism they’re often squandered
 
employer-funded job training has fallen by more than one-third in the past two decades even as the premium on skilled workers has increased in a competitive global economy  and even where training programs do exist too few are focused on providing broadly applicable sectoral skills
 
the decline of unions and worker bargaining power has led to a decline in worker voices in long-term decision-making at many companies
and it no surprise that we’ve seen corporate investment in human capital decline as well  i think we need to start trying to reverse all of these trends
 
as president i will fight to defend workers’ rights and encourage more companies to invest in their employees
 
in this campaign i’ve already proposed a $1500 dollar apprenticeship tax credit for every new worker that businesses train and hire as well as a plan to encourage more companies to offer generous profit sharing programs
 
i’ve also called for raising the minimum wage and implementing president obama new rules on overtime
 
and let me add i agree with new york proposal this week to raise wages for fast food workers to $15 an hour the national minimum wage is a floor and it needs to be raised
 
but let also remember that the cost of living in manhattan is different than in little rock and many other places so new york or los angeles or seattle are right to go higher
 
now if we’re going to ask the private sector to invest in the long-term let all face up to the fact that washington may well be the worst offender of all when it comes to short-term thinking and this is the fifth area of reform that is desperately needed
 
it time to end the era of budget brinksmanship in congress and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another  that just creates more uncertainty for business for investors and for our country
 
you know i’ve been asking a lot of business leaders with whom i have talked what are a couple of things you would love to see happen’ and almost to a person they always say we need more predictability we have no idea what going to come out of washington we can deal with whatever does – but when we don’t know when it doesn’t come when there are stalemates when there are government shutdowns – that interferes with our business and particularly with our global business’ which is kind of an obvious thing to say but i hope people in washington will pay attention
 
and let stop pouring subsidies into industries that are already thriving – like the giveaways in the tax code to the oil companies – and start investing in the future to create millions of more new jobs in the new economy
 
we should be making smart investments in infrastructure innovation education and clean energy that will help businesses and entrepreneurs grow and create the next generation of high-paying jobs
and we know the investments that would be made in these areas have very high returns  there no excuse not to make them – and to make them now
 
for example we should improve and make permanent the research and experimentation tax credit  every few years congress has another squabble over whether to renew this credit they’ve done it 16 times in the past thirty-five years  isn’t it time we stopped kicking the can down the road and actually got down to doing the people business
 
and as important as the specific reforms i’ve outlined here are the truth is that the fight against quarterly capitalism cannot be won in washington alone the private sector has to rise to this challenge we’re already seeing a movement for change taking shape investors executives and employees are all starting to step up union leaders are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow clean energy economy – and they earn good returns doing that
 
we need to build on this momentum it time to return to an old fashioned idea that companies’ responsibility to their shareholders also encompasses a responsibility to employees customers communities and ultimately to our country and yes our planet the strength and legitimacy of american capitalism have always depended on its ability to create opportunities for hard-working families to get ahead generation after generation  we can’t lose sight of that
 
i’m pleased that since 2010 thirty-one states have enacted legislation authorizing so-called benefit73 corporations which allow companies to pursue both profit and social purpose  senator mark warner has suggested that we recognize a new corporate form and reward companies that invest in their workers  that proposal has real merit and we should explore it further
 
what good for middle class families also happens to be good economics we know that strong sustainable growth can only happen when communities are thriving and workers are well paid
 
and after all our economy is a 70% consumption economy it that old henry ford story when he decided he was going to be paying his workers as i recall the princely sum of $5 a day and a lot of his peers really rose up in opposition how can you do this you’re going to throw off the labor market you’re setting a bad example’ and his response was i’m building these cars i need people to buy them’
 
well our economy is not yet running the way it should in large measure because we’re not putting enough money in the paychecks of enough americans so that they in turn can be fueling this consumption economy which not only holds up the american economy but holds up the global economy
 
it in everyone interest – including corporate america – to contribute to a vibrant middle class and rising incomes
 
now as president i won’t try to impose a one-size-fits-all solution  but i will use the power the convening power of the office to bring all relevant parties together to help move our corporate culture toward solid long-term growth and investment
 
just imagine how different our history would have been if short-termism had dominated earlier eras the way it does today
 
what if an activist hedge fund had persuaded at73t to maximize cash flow and close bell labs before the transistor or the laser was invented there
 
what if xerox had decided that its palo alto research park wasn’t doing enough to boost share prices in the short term  a young steve jobs would never have visited and the personal computer revolution might not have happened
 
what if congressional budget cuts had shut down darpa – the defense advanced research projects agency – before it developed the early internet
 
today we face a choice – between the future and the past
 
the republicans running for president seem totally unconcerned about the problem of quarterly capitalism  in fact their policies would make it worse  most would eliminate capital gains taxes for wealthy investors with no incentives for long-term holding  they’d wipe out the new rules on wall street imposed after the crisis  and of course they’d further strip worker rights and weaken bargaining power
 
indeed their approach to government mirrors the worst tendencies of hit and run shareholders demanding quick payouts in the form of tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of investing in the future  they ignore long-term challenges like climate change poverty and inequality failing infrastructure just look at the current mess in congress with the highway bill
 
we can’t afford to return to the same out-of-touch out-of-date policies that wrecked our economy before
 
we have to work together to drive strong growth fair growth and long-term growth
 
that the only way we will renew the basic bargain of america  you know it if you work hard you should be able to get ahead and stay ahead  and when you do america gets ahead too
 
it the only way we’re going to build an american economy for tomorrow not yesterday
 
i invite you to join me in this discussion i’m looking for new creative innovative disruptive ideas that will save capitalism for the 21st century because it is the greatest engine of economic opportunity and potential that has ever been invented it one of the great accomplishments of the american political and economic history it created the opportunities that so many generations of americans took advantage of and that led to the middle class – the extraordinary economic accomplishment of our country
 
and as we’ve had to do in previous eras it needs to be reinvented it needs to be put back into balance it needs to recognize that we really are all in this together – and the better we all do the more there will be for everybody to share in to invest in to profit from
 
so i ask you and particularly here at stern – the students and the faculty and others who are studying business – help us think through the best ways to change the culture to move it back to where it used to be which was much more focused on long-term investing with the results of the extraordinary prosperity that we enjoyed for decades
 
we have new challenges from technology and globalization and other big problems on the horizon – like climate change for example – but that is what we are best at doing in this country we are problem solvers not problem deniers we roll up our sleeves we get to work and we keep moving forward it is always all about tomorrow
 
love that song don’t stop thinking about tomorrow’
 
so help me think about it and let make it happen
 
thank you all very much73




thank you thank you thank you so much thank you very much president van zandt and thanks to everyone at the new school for welcoming us today i’m delighted to be back
 
you know over the past few months i’ve had the opportunity to listen to americans’ concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for them it not delivering the way it should – it still seems to most americans that i have spoken with that it is stacked for those at the top  
 
but i’ve also heard their hopes for the future going to college without drowning in debt… starting that small business they’ve always dreamed about… getting a job that pays well enough to support a family and provide for a secure retirement 
 
previous generations of americans built the greatest economy and strongest middle class the world has ever known on the promise of a basic bargain 
 
if you work hard and do your part you should be able to get ahead and when you get ahead america gets ahead  
 
but over several decades that bargain has eroded our job is to make it strong again 
 
for 35 years republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top – by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules – it will trickle down it will trickle down to everyone else  
 
yet every time they have a chance to try that approach it explodes the national debt concentrates wealth even more and does practically nothing to help hard-working americans  
 
twice now in the past 20 years a democratic president has had to come in and clean up the mess i think the results speak for themselves  
 
under president clinton – i like the sound of that - america saw the longest peacetime expansion in history … nearly 23 million jobs a balanced budget and a surplus for the future and most importantly incomes rose across the board not just for those already at the top 
 
eight years later president obama and the american people hard work pulled us back from the brink of depression president obama saved the auto industry imposed new rules on wall street and provided health care to 16 million americans 
 
now today today as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer-term challenges come into focus i believe we have to build a growth and fairness73 economy you can’t have one without the other
 
we can’t create enough jobs and new businesses without more growth and we can’t build strong families and support our consumer economy without more fairness 
 
we need both because while america is standing again we’re not yet running the way we should  
 
corporate profits are at near-record highs and americans are working as hard as ever -- but paychecks have barely budged in real terms  
 
families today are stretched in so many directions and so are their budgets out-of-pocket costs of health care childcare caring for aging parents are rising a lot faster than wages  
 
i hear this everywhere i go 
 
the single mom who talked to me about juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids she doesn’t expect anything to come easy but if she got a raise everything wouldn’t be quite so hard 
 
the grandmother who works around the clock providing childcare to other people kids  
she proud of her work but the pay is barely enough to live on especially with the soaring price of her prescription drugs  
 
the young entrepreneur whose dream of buying the bowling alley where he worked as a teenager was nearly derailed by his student debt if he can grow his business he’ll be able to pay off his debt and pay his employees including himself more too 
 
millions of hard-working americans tell similar stories  
 
wages need to rise to keep up with costs 
 
paychecks need to grow  
 
families who work hard and do their part deserve to get ahead and stay ahead 
 
the defining economic challenge of our time is clear  
 
we must raise incomes for hard-working americans so they can afford a middle-class life we must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country  
 
and that will be my mission from the first day i’m president to the last i will get up everyday thinking about the families of america like the family that i came from with a hard working dad who started a small business and scrimped and saved and gave us a good middle class life i’ll be thinking about all the people that i represented here in new york and the stories that they told me and that i worked with them to improve and i will as your president take on this challenge against the backdrop of major changes in our economy and the global economy that didn’t start with the recession and won’t end with the recovery  
 
you know advances in technology and expanding global trade have created whole new areas of commercial activity and opened new markets for our exports but too often they’re also polarizing our economy -- benefiting high-skilled workers but displacing or downgrading blue collar jobs and other midlevel jobs that used to provide solid incomes for millions of americans 
 
today marketplace focuses too much on the short term – like second-to-second financial trading and quarterly earnings reports – and too little on long-term investments 
 
meanwhile many americans are making extra money renting out a spare room designing websites selling products they design themselves at home or even driving their own car this on demand73 or so-called gig economy73 is creating exciting opportunities and unleashing innovation but it also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future
 
so all of these trends are real and none none is going away but they don’t determine our destiny the choices we make as a nation matter and the choices we make in the years ahead will set the stage for what american life in the middle class in our economy will be like in this century 
 
as president i will work with every possible partner to turn the tide to make these currents of change start working for us more than against us to strengthen –not hollow out – the american middle class
 
because i think at our best that what americans do  we’re problem solvers not deniers we don’t hide from change – we harness it 
 
the measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for hard-working families not just for successful ceos and money managers and not just some arbitrary growth target untethered to people lives and livelihoods 
 
i want to see our economy work for the struggling the striving and the successful
 
we’re not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past  we can’t go back to the old policies that failed us before nor can we just replay previous successes today is not 1993 or 2009 we need solutions for the big challenges we face now
 
so today i am proposing an agenda to raise incomes for hard-working americans an agenda for strong growth fair growth and long-term growth  
 
let me begin with strong growth  
 
more growth means more jobs and more new businesses more jobs give people choices about where to work and employers have to offer higher wages and better benefits in order to compete with each other to hire new workers and keep the productive ones that why economists tell us that getting closer to full employment is crucial for raising incomes  
 
small businesses create more than 60 percent of new american jobs on net so they have to be a top priority i’ve said i want to be the small business president and i mean it  and throughout this campaign i’m going to be talking about how we empower entrepreneurs with less red tape easier access to capital tax relief and simplification
 
i’ll also push for broader business tax reform to spur investment in america closing those loopholes that reward companies for sending jobs and profits overseas 
 
and i know it not always how we think about this but another engine of strong growth should be comprehensive immigration reform 
 
i want you to hear this bringing millions of hard-working people into the formal economy would increase our gross domestic product by an estimated $700 billion over 10 years
 
then there are the new public investments that will help established businesses and entrepreneurs create the next generation of high-paying jobs
 
you know when we get americans moving we get our country moving  
 
so let establish an infrastructure bank that can channel more public and private funds channel those funds to finance world-class airports railways roads bridges and ports 
 
and let build those faster broadband networks – and make sure there a greater diversity of providers so consumers have more choice
 
and really there no excuse not to make greater investments in cleaner renewable energy right now our economy obviously runs on energy and the time has come to make america the world clean energy superpower  i advocate that because these investments will create millions of jobs save us money in the long run and help us meet the threats of climate change 
 
and let fund the scientific and medical research that spawns innovative companies and creates entire new industries just as the project to sequence the human genome did in the 1990s and president obama initiatives on precision medicine and brain research will do in the coming years
 
i will set ambitious goals in all of these areas in the months ahead  
 
but today let me emphasize another key ingredient of strong growth that often goes overlooked and undervalued breaking down barriers so more americans participate more fully in the workforce – especially women
 
we are in a global competition as i’m sure you have noticed and we can’t afford to leave talent on the sidelines but that exactly what we’re doing today when we leave people out or write them off we not only shortchange them and their dreams — we shortchange our country and our future
 
the movement of women into the workforce over the past forty years was responsible for more than three and a half trillion dollars in economic growth 
 
but that progress has stalled the united states used to rank 7th out of 24 advanced countries in women labor force participation by 2013 we had dropped to 19th that represents a lot of unused potential for our economy and for american families 
 
studies show that nearly a third of this decline relative to other countries is because they’re expanding family-friendly policies like paid leave and we are not  
 
we should be making it easier for americans to be both good workers and good parents and caregivers women who want to work should be able to do so without worrying every day about how they’re going to take care of their children or what will happen if a family member gets sick  
 
you know last year while i was at the hospital here in manhattan waiting for little charlotte to make her grand entrance one of the nurses said thank you for fighting for paid leave73 and we began to talk about it she sees first-hand what it means for herself and her colleagues as well as for the working parents that she helps take care of
 
it time to recognize that quality affordable childcare is not a luxury – it a growth strategy and it way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job — and women of color making even less  
 
all this lost money adds up and for some women it thousands of dollars every year  
 
now i am well aware that for far too long these challenges have been dismissed by some as women issues73 
 
well those days are over 
 
fair pay and fair scheduling paid family leave and earned sick days child care are essential to our competitiveness and growth  
 
and we can do this in a way that doesn’t impose unfair burdens on businesses – especially small businesses 
 
as president i’ll fight to put families first – just like i have my entire career 
 
now beyond strong growth we also need fair growth and that will be the second key driver of rising incomes 
 
the evidence is in inequality is a drag on our entire economy so this is the problem we need to tackle 
 
you may have heard governor bush say last week that americans just need to work longer hours well he must not have met very many american workers 
 
let him tell that to the nurse who stands on her feet all day or the trucker who drives all night let him tell that to the fast food workers marching in the streets for better pay they don’t need a lecture – they need a raise 
 
the truth is the current rules for our economy reward some work – like financial trading – much more than other work like actually building and selling things the work that always been the backbone of our economy  
 
to get all incomes rising again we need to strike a better balance if you work hard you ought to be paid fairly so we have to raise the minimum wage and implement president obama new rules on overtime and then we have to go further 
 
i’ll crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages 
 
to make paychecks stretch we need to take on the major strains on family budgets i’ll protect the affordable care act – and build on it to lower out-of-pocket health care costs and to make prescription drugs more affordable
 
we’ll help families look forward to retirement by defending and enhancing social security and making it easier to save for the future  
 
now many of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle-scarred we need new ideas as well and one that i believe in and will fight for is profit sharing 
 
hard working americans deserve to benefit from the record corporate earnings they help produce so i will propose ways to encourage companies to share profits with their employees
 
that good for workers and good for business  
 
studies show profit-sharing that gives everyone a stake in a company success can boost productivity and put money directly into employees’ pockets it a win-win 
 
later this week in new hampshire i’ll have more to say about how we do this
 
another priority must be reforming our tax code 
 
now we hear republican candidates talk a lot about tax reform but take a good look at their plans senator rubio would cut taxes for households making around $3 million a year by almost $240000 – which is way more than three times the earnings of a typical family well that a sure budget-busting give-away to the super-wealthy and that the kind of bad economics you’re likely to get from any of the candidates on the other side 
 
i have a different take guided by some simple principles  
 
first hard-working families need and deserve tax relief and simplification  
 
second those at the top have to pay their fair share that why i support the buffett rule which makes sure that millionaires don’t pay lower rates than their secretaries  
 
i have also called for closing the carried interest loophole which lets wealthy financiers pay an artificially low rate
 
and let agree that hugely successful companies that benefit from everything america has to offer should not be able to game the system and avoid paying their fair share… especially while companies who can’t afford high-price lawyers and lobbyists end up paying more 
 
alongside tax reform it time to stand up to efforts across our country to undermine worker bargaining power which has been proven again and again to drive up wages  
 
republicans governors like scott walker have made their names stomping on workers’ rights and practically all the republican candidates hope to do the same as president  
 
i will fight back against these mean-spirited misguided attacks 
 
evidence shows that the decline of unions may be responsible for a third of the increase of inequality among men so if we want to get serious about raising incomes we have to get serious about supporting workers 
 
and let me just say a word here about trade the greek crisis as well as the chinese stock market have reminded us that growth here at home and growth an ocean away are linked in a common global economy trade has been a major driver of the economy over recent decades but it has also contributed to hollowing out our manufacturing base and many hard-working communities so we do need to set a high bar for trade agreements  
 
we should support them if they create jobs raise wages and advance our national security and we should be prepared to walk away if they don’t 
 
to create fair growth we need to create opportunity for more americans 
 
i love the saying by abraham lincoln who in many ways was not only the president who saved our union but the president who understood profoundly the importance of the middle class and the importance of the government playing its role in providing opportunities he talked about giving americans a fair chance in the race of life i believe that with all my heart but i also believe it has to start really early at birth high quality early learning especially in the first five years can set children on the course for future success and raise lifetime incomes by 25 percent 
 
i’m committed to seeing every 4-year old in america have access to high-quality preschool in the next ten years  but i want to do more i want to call for a great outpouring of support from our faith community our business community our academic institutions from philanthropy and civic groups and concerned citizens to really help parents particularly parents who are facing a lot of obstacles to really help prepare their own children in that zero to four age group 
 
80% of your brain is physically formed by age of three that why families like mine read talk and sing endlessly to our granddaughter i’ve said that her first words are going to be enough with the reading and the talking and the singing but we do it not only because we love doing it even though i’ll admit it a little embarrassing to be reading a book to a two-week old or a six-week old a ten-week old but we do it because we understand that it building her capacity for learning and the research shows that by the time she enters kindergarten she will have heard 30 million more words than i child from a less privileged background
 
think of what we are losing because we are not doing everything we can to reach out to those families and we know again from so much research here in the united states and around the world that the early help that mentoring that intervention to help those often-stressed out young moms understand more about what they can do and avoid the difficulties that stand in the way of their being able to get their child off to the best start
 
we also have to invest in our students and teachers at every level  
 
and in the coming weeks and months i’ll lay out specific steps to improve our schools make college truly affordable and help americans refinance their student debt  
 
let embrace the idea of lifelong learning in an age of technological change we need to provide pathways to get skills and credentials for new occupations and create online platforms to connect workers to jobs there are exciting efforts underway and i want to support and scale the ones that show results  
 
as we pursue all these policies we can’t forget our fellow americans hit so hard and left behind by this changing economy— from the inner cities to coal country to indian country  talent is universal – you find it everywhere – but opportunity is not   
 
there are nearly 6 million young people aged 16 to 24 in america today who are not in school or at work the numbers for young people of color are particularly staggering a quarter of young black men and nearly 15 percent of all latino youth cannot find a job  
 
we’ve got to do a better way of coming up to match the growing middle class incomes we want to generate with more pathways into the middle class i firmly believe that the best anti-poverty program is a job but that hard to say if there are not enough jobs for people that we are trying to help lift themselves out of poverty
 
that why i’ve called for reviving the new markets tax credit and empowerment zones to create greater incentives to invest in poor and remote areas
 
when all americans have the chance to study hard work hard and share in our country prosperity – that fair growth  it what i’ve always believed in and it what i will fight for as president 
 
now the third key driver of income alongside strong growth and fair growth must be long-term growth 
 
too many pressures in our economy today push us toward short-termism many business leaders see this they’ve talked to me about one has called it the problem of quarterly capitalism73 they say everything focused on the next earnings report or the short-term share price the result is too little attention on the sources of long-term growth research and development physical capital and talent 
  
net business investment -- which includes things like factories machines and research labs -- has declined as a share of the economy in recent years some of our biggest companies have spent more than half their earnings to buy back their own stock and another third or more to pay dividends that doesn’t leave a lot left to raise pay or invest in the workers who made those profits possible or to make the new investments necessary to insure a company future success these trends need to change and i believe that many business leaders are eager to embrace their responsibilities not just to today share price but also to workers communities and ultimately to our country and indeed our planet  
 
i’m not talking about charity – i’m talking about clear-eyed capitalism many companies have prospered by improving wages and training their workers that then yield higher productivity better service and larger profits 
 
now it easy to try to cut costs by holding down or decreasing pay and other investments to inflate quarterly stock prices but i would argue that bad for business in the long run  
 
and it really bad for our country
 
workers are assets  investing in them pays off  higher wages pay off  and training pays off  
 
to help more companies do that i’ve proposed a new $1500 apprenticeship tax credit for every worker they train and hire 
  
and i will soon be proposing a new plan to reform capital gains taxes to reward longer-term investments that create jobs more than just quick trades 
 
i will also propose reforms to help ceos and shareholders alike focus on the next decade rather than just the next day making sure stock buybacks aren’t being used only for an immediate boost in share prices empowering outside investors who want to build companies but discouraging cut and run73 shareholders who act more like old-school corporate raiders and nowhere will the shift from short-term to long-term be more important than on wall street 
 
as a former senator from new york i know first-hand the role that wall street can and should play in our economy -- helping main street grow and prosper and boosting new companies that make america more competitive globally 
 
but as we all know in the years before the crash financial firms piled risk upon risk and regulators in washington either couldn’t or wouldn’t keep up  
 
i was alarmed by this gathering storm and called for addressing the risks of derivatives cracking down on subprime mortgages and improving financial oversight  
  
under president obama leadership we’ve imposed tough new rules that deal with some of the challenges on wall street but those rules have been under assault by republicans in congress and those running for president  
 
i will fight back against these attacks and protect the reforms we’ve made we can do that and still ease burdens on community banks to encourage responsible loans to local people and businesses they know and trust
 
we also have to go beyond dodd-frank  
 
too many of our major financial institutions are still too complex and too risky and the problems are not limited to the big banks that get all the headlines serious risks are emerging from institutions in the so-called shadow banking73 system – including hedge funds high frequency traders non-bank finance companies –  so many new kinds of entities which receive little oversight at all 
 
stories of misconduct by individuals and institutions in the financial industry are shocking hsbc allowing drug cartels to launder money five major banks pleading guilty to felony charges for conspiring to manipulate currency exchange and interest rates there can be no justification or tolerance for this kind of criminal behavior 
 
and while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences – or none at all even when they’ve already pocketed the gains  
 
this is wrong and on my watch it will change
 
over the course of this campaign i will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on wall street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors not just high frequency traders and those with the best – or fastest -- connections  
 
i will appoint and empower regulators who understand that too big to fail is still too big a problem 
 
we’ll ensure that no firm is too complex to manage or oversee  
 
and we will prosecute individuals as well as firms when they commit fraud or other criminal wrongdoing 
 
and when the government recovers money from corporations or individuals for harming the public it should go into a separate trust fund to benefit the public it could for example help modernize infrastructure or even be returned directly to taxpayers
 
now reform is never easy but we have done it before in our country but we have to get this right and we need leadership from the financial industry and across the private sector to join with us
 
two years ago the head of the chicago mercantile exchange terry duffy published an op-ed in the wall street journal that really caught my attention  he wrote and i quote i’m concerned that those of us in financial services have forgotten who we serve—and that the public knows it… some wall streeters can too easily slip into regarding their work as a kind of money-making game divorced from the concerns of main street73 
 
i think we should listen to terry duffy
 
of course long-term growth is only possible if the public sector steps up as well
 
so it time to end the era of budget brinksmanship and stop careening from one self-inflicted crisis to another it time to stop having debates over the small stuff and focus on how we’re going to tackle the big stuff together  
 
how do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys  
 
can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing  
 
what are the best ways to nurture start-ups outside the successful corridors like silicon valley  
 
questions like these demand thoughtful and mature debate from our policy makers in government from our leaders in the private sector and our economists our academics and others who can come to the table on behalf of america and perform their patriotic duty to ensure that our economy keeps working and our middle class keeps growing 
 
so government has to be smarter simpler more focused itself on long-term investments than short-term politics – and be a better partner to cities states and the private sector  
washington has to be a better steward of america’ tax-dollars and americans’ trust and please let get back to making decisions that rely on evidence more than ideology 
 
that what i’ll do as president  i will seek out and welcome any good idea that is actually based on reality  i want to have principled and pragmatic and progressive policies that really move us forward together and i will propose ways to ensure that our fiscal outlook is sustainable — including by continuing to restrain healthcare costs which remain one of the key drivers of long-term deficits i will make sure washington learns from how well local governments business and non-profits are working together in successful cities and towns across america  
 
you know passing legislation is not the only way to drive progress as president i’ll use the power to convene connect and collaborate to build partnerships that actually get things done 
 
because above all we have to break out of the poisonous partisan gridlock and focus on the long-term needs of our country 
 
i confess maybe it the grandmother in me but i believe that part of public service is planting trees under whose shade you’ll never sit 
 
and the vision i’ve laid our here today – for strong growth fair growth and long term growth all working together — will get incomes rising again will help working families get ahead and stay ahead   
 
that is the test of our time and i’m inviting everyone to please join me to do your part that what great countries do that what our country always has done we rise to challenges 
 
it not about left right or center – it about the future versus the past
 
i’m running for president to build an america for tomorrow not yesterday  
an america built on growth and fairness  
an america where if you do your part you will reap the rewards 
 
where we don’t leave anyone out or anyone behind 
 
thank you all thank you i just want to leave you with one more thought 
 
i want every child every child in our country not just the granddaughter of a former president or a former secretary of state but every child to have the chance to live up to his or her god-given potential 
 
please join me in that mission let do it all together
 
thank you so much73







































 
sec hillary clinton  thank you    thank you so much   
 
thank you  oh i am thrilled to be here and to be in such a beautiful facility having just had the chance to spend a little time with some children mostly four year olds but a few five year olds  it was great 
 
and i thank julie and the entire team here at the y  im such a big believer in this kind of partnership  and i was thrilled as julie was talking about it to see the  break out on behalf of this ymca and all that it does
 
this is for me a very important place to be to talk about a really critical issue one that as julie has said i have spent much of my adult life being committed to and concerned about  and i cant think of a better place to do this than here in new hampshire a state that will always have a special place in my heart   
 
i had a great event saturday in a perfect place on a perfect day on roosevelt island in new york city at the four freedoms park that was constructed in honor of president roosevelt 
 
and i was able to talk about the four fights that i want to wage and win on behalf of the american people  they to me really encapsulate what my campaign is about but also what our country needs to do together  build an economy for tomorrow not yesterday strengthen america families because when our families are strong america is strong harness all of our power not just the military but diplomatic and economic to use our values to lead the world and to revitalize our democracy here at home particularly by focusing on getting dark unaccountable money out of politics even if it takes a constitutional amendment   
 
and i will be rolling out specific policies over the weeks to come but i do believe with all my heart that everything we need to do in our country really starts with how we treat our children and how we try to raise them taking care of their needs being able to stimulate them to give them a better chance in life helping them become successful and good citizens
 
and for me all of this does come back to our kids  that because my mother who was with me in new hampshire in 2008 really taught me that everybody needs a chance and everybody needs a champion  
 
and for her she knew what it was like not to have either when she was growing up because she was abandoned very young by her parents and sent to live with grandparents who didnt want her so that by the time she was 14 she was out on her own working as a housemaid and a babysitter in another family home
 
and i didnt know any of this when i was growing up when i was the age of the kids we were reading the very hungry caterpillar to  i just knew she was my mom and she was great and she was fun and she taught me so much  and she made grilled cheese and tomato soup sandwiches  i mean there was just a wonderful sense of being loved and taken care of but also being inspired
 
and i remember asking her when i got old enough to kind of piece together some of the answers to questions i was getting about her childhood how could she do this  and her answer was very simple  you know kindness along the way from people that cared about her and showed her she mattered the first grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat for lunch and without embarrassing her started bringing extra food and then would lean over and whisper dorothy i brought too much food today would you like some  i cant eat it all 
 
or even the woman whose house she went to work in she wanted so much to go to high school but she knew she had to do the chores that were necessary  and so the woman said well if you can get your chores done you can go to high school  and that was a great gift that my mother was forever grateful for
 
because those people believed in her she believed in me  you know there is a direct link if we believe in our children we instill in them the belief that they are worth something and then they in turn can pass that on
 
now ideally we all hope that families can do that but in today world it really hard for many families to do everything theyre expected to do under the stresses that they face 
 
because of her i believe in the potential of every american and particularly every american child  and when our children succeed america succeeds
 
so ive been a champion for early childhood education for as long as i can remember really starting when i was in law school and got interested in as i was studying the law why do some people follow the law and other people dont  what in their background  what makes them either a productive member of society or somebody on the outside who may be trying to tear down instead of build up
 
and that why im putting this front and center in my campaign because i think it time we realize once and for all that investing in our children is one of the best investments our country can make  
 
now i think most of us kind of intuitively have known that but now research is telling us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success
 
so we have to help parents be their children first teachers from that very first day and we have to help them get access to quality affordable childcare and preschool 
and for me it recognizing the reality of today families  forty percent of the breadwinners the principal breadwinners in america today are women  we have a lot of single moms heroically trying to raise kids under sometimes very challenging circumstances  we have a lot of two-parent families where people are working nightshifts theyre overlapping they are just doing everything they can sometimes with multiple jobs to keep body and soul together and put that food on the table and that roof over the head
 
today parents have to juggle so much  they have to squeeze every minute out of every 24 hour day
 
and that just makes the argument even stronger as to why we have to have their backs why we have to be there to help them do the best job they can possibly do
 
yes they need to do the job that pays them but at the end of the day the job raising children taking care of your family caring even for your parents as they age is the most important job any of us will ever do  and we dont do it for pay we do it for love we do it for a sense of giving back but let try to figure out how to make it a little bit easier    
 
you know i met a woman a couple weeks ago who was trying to do everything she could imagine to make it work  she was a single mom  she was raising three kids  she was working and she was going to community college because she was trying to get ahead so that she could get a better job  she said you know i dont ask for anything but why does it have to be so hard 
 
i hear that question all over  why does it have to be so hard
 
it hard enough to pay for any preschool or childcare at all let alone the quality programs that help kids develop and flourish  funding for these opportunities has not kept up with changing times and rising demand
 
so it not surprise that out-of-pocket childcare costs for families have soared by nearly 25 percent the past decade  in many states it costs more for childcare of quality than it costs for college tuition  and we know what happened at that end of the learning curve
 
we actually did make a lot of progress expanding preschool attendance for three and four year olds during the 1990s  i was honored to hold the first ever white house conference on early childhood development to bring together people like those you see here  
 
but starting in 2001 there been almost no progress  only 55 percent of all of america three and four-year olds are enrolled in preschool  and meanwhile many of our economic competitors are racing ahead  they are making big investments in preschool and early education
 
ill tell you a little story  you know i spent a lot of time as secretary of state trying to figure out how we were going to deal with the rise of china  it going to be one of the biggest problems for the next president  and there are a lot of aspects to it 
 
but i was not surprised to get a call about two years ago shortly after i left the state department on behalf of the highest ranking woman in the chinese government  and she was coming to washington  and i had worked with her as secretary of state  she asked if she could see me and i said of course id be happy to see her
 
and then she said you know could you do an event with me about early childhood  i said oh certainly what is it about early childhood that has you so interested
 
here what she said and then we did the event  we did the event at the brookings institute in washington  china making a huge commitment to early childhood and to pre-kindergarten  why  they look at the same brain research  in fact they have asked the american nobel prize winning economist from the university of chicago hardly a hotbed of radical liberalism -- laughter -- to be their consultant among others because he did the study which proved that early childhood investing by a country is one of the best returns on investment that we can make    so the chinese are using an american expert for that  so if i hadnt been excited before i got really motivated about this 
 
but unfortunately were hearing something different from republican leaders in washington  republicans arent just missing the boat on early childhood education theyre trying to sink it  their budget puts at risk one of the most effective investments for our youngest children early head start
 
did they cut subsidies to oil companies  no  did they cut tax loopholes like carried interest for hedge fund managers  no  the republicans took care of those at the top and went after the kids
 
now i believe getting off to a good start should be our children birthright part of the basic bargain that we have with each other as a nation  every child should have the tools and the skills to thrive in tomorrow economy especially those kids from our most vulnerable and at-risk communities
 
and we need to make sure that parents can get good jobs and stay in the workforce  that drives the economic engine  so we have to do more to help them deal with the most difficult of the decisions of parents for young children to stay in the workforce
 
i believe the time has come to make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in america  if our families are going to be strong and our economy is going to thrive all our kids need the chance to get off to the best possible start  
 
i will work with states and communities across america to make sure that in the next 10 years every four year old in america has access to high quality preschool  now already governors and state legislatures across the country are discovering the value of preschool  and this is bipartisan 
 
you know one of the states with a universal pre-k program in america is oklahoma about as red a state as you can get  but they have figured it out the government and business leaders and families like that this is a smart investment for them
 
 
and we have to build on the momentum started by the states  now look how far here in new hampshire youve come  nearly 20 years ago back when senator jeanne shaheen was governor shaheen she delivered funding for public kindergarten for the first time in the state history  
 
that then allowed the conversation to move where it is today with governor maggie hassan supporting efforts for full day kindergarten and innovative pre-k partnerships
 
so you start and you get what you have achieved on kindergarten then you move toward full day and then innovative pre-k
 
all across the country we need to be doing that and we also need to invest in childcare because if you only start at four the brain research shows that 80 percent of your brain has developed by the age of three  now the good news is that leaves 20 percent to keep working on  laughter  but it is a fact that by three many of our kids have already had most of the brain development that theyre going to get
 
and in this campaign ill offer a comprehensive agenda to ensure that every child in america has access to quality affordable childcare  
 
i will propose a middle class tax cut to help parents deal with rising childcare costs   
 
and ill lead an effort to expand childcare opportunities and to make sure that programs address both the needs of working parents and the needs of children
 
we shouldnt think of childcare as just a place to deposit your kids a warehouse  we should invest in programs that create healthy environments for early learning
 
and to make sure that parents get the support they need from the time their children are infants i will double the early head start childcare partnership grant program which brings head starts evidence-based curriculum into the childcare setting to provide comprehensive full day high quality services to low income families and i will double our investment in early head start itself a program i helped to create when i was first lady    and we know it making a difference because we actually have evidence that shows it making a difference
 
and this is part as i said of a long term commitment of mine going back to my methodist church where i was raised and babysitting children of mexican migrant farmworkers through my years at the children defense fund working to expand opportunities for kids with disabilities and through my time in the white house with my husband and in the senate in new york and even as secretary of state because i have learned that talent is universal but opportunity is not  
 
and i look sometimes in the eyes of kids whove had a really tough set of obstacles to overcome and theyre doing the best they can  and we need to do what we can do to help them succeed
 
but every baby comes into this world with so much god-given potential  and when they leave the hospital some will have every opportunity their family can give them and others will struggle
 
now as you may have heard i am a new grandmother  laughter   and so for me this has become really personal  i remember being in the hospital waiting for charlotte arrival and talking to the nurses there  and what did they want to talk to me about  they wanted to talk to me about how hard it was for them plus a lot of their patients to get childcare  how it was especially hard when they had to work the night shift  how they had to keep juggling everything all the time
 
and it was here at one of the great moments of my life a reminder that there are so many hardworking conscientious people who deserve more help than theyre getting right now  and it needs to be a partnership just like this y is a partnership a partnership between the public and private interests a partnership where people feel that they can contribute and participate
 
i think if we come together and take this on as a true national mission we can unlock the potential of all our children and further the potential of our country  and our country then will be more inclusive not leaving people behind and out and where a father can tell his daughter you can grow up to be anything you want including president of the united states  /
 
 
 
 
sec hillary clinton  you know jackie i think that a great perspective to put on it because when we talk about early childhood we think about the little kids like the ones that we were with in the class room  but we ought to have a broader perspective and think about the adults they will become  and what kind of adults do we need  we need people who will have exactly the skills for jobs that havent been invented and well have the temperament and the character and the attributes to get along with people to respect the law respect each other to be part of building a stronger more prosperous america
 
and i think it a great perspective if you kind of work backwards and you say to yourself okay what are you going to look for in somebody who wants to be a worker and a citizen in 15 20 30 years  you know that that really starts so importantly at the beginning
 

 
sec hillary clinton  oh i do agree  and i think your story is really important for everybody to hear because that is the reality that is going on right now  i just meet so many working parents and particularly single working moms who are struggling  they are really working as hard as they can as you were and many of them trying to go to school at the same time because they know theyll have a better future if they do
 
i remember when i was teaching law at the university of arkansas oh gosh back in the early 1970s i met so many people around the campus who were single parents trying to go to school and childcare was their biggest obstacle  and we started a fund called the arkansas single parent scholarship fund because it wasnt the money that they needed so much for the tuition although that was a stretch it was all the other expenses that surrounded the difficulty of them being able to get their education
 
and i think you have to look at what young families are going through today in a very comprehensive way and say okay what can the extended family do  what can the houses of worship our churches do  what can communities do  what can the y do or the boys and girls club  there so many different ways to kind of piece this together  but there isnt any way to get to a universal program unless our government in washington sees it as a priority to partner with many of the states and localities  we have the mayor here thank you for being here mayor so that we can provide the backstop and the support that is necessary
 
and it is particularly important for the youngest kids the zero to three kids because those are kids who need a lot more personal attention  bill and i are exhausted every time we take care of charlotte  we love every minute of it but it reminds you how hard it is to raise babies and keep an eye on them as they take off on their own  so i think it is important that we do everything we can to deal with that zero to three age group and that going to take more direction
 
that why i mentioned the early head start childcare partnership and the early head start program  but again we need more people to help fill that space because that often where parents really are stretched and we also dont have a lot of time off for a lot of working parents  and so just getting everything organized when you have that new baby is a challenge dont you think
 
 
sec hillary clinton  well that why i said im going to offer a middle class tax cut that can go toward helping parents pay for quality childcare because youve put your finger on one of the biggest problems  a lot of parents cannot afford quality childcare and a lot of the teachers and the childcare workers cant afford to live on what the parents can pay
 
so you have a perfect storm where we need quality childcare but how are we going to get the people with the continuity so that the experience is there to be able to deliver that childcare when parents cant go any further  theyre stretched as far as they can get  and i have been meeting with childcare workers and a lot of them just throw up their hands  theyd rather go be a food server for the money but not for the reward that they have gotten from taking care of kids  theyre making $8-9-10 an hour for often 12-hour days  and that is just a huge burden on them and their families  and so then you have a downward spiral
 
is that what youve seen too
 

 
sec hillary clinton  well i want to throw it open for -- i know there are a lot of people in this audience who care deeply about this issue have their own experience in doing the issue  and so julie i think we should see if somebody else wants to contribute to the conversation
 
 
 
sec hillary clinton  there is a roving microphone
 
 
sec hillary clinton  can i ask you without -- i dont want to impinge on your privacy what are the circumstances under which youre raising your grandchildren and your friends are
 
 
sec hillary clinton  i have to tell you this is -- thank you thank you  im so so sorry  but you are the second grandmother in new hampshire who has said that to me  and that one of the reasons why if you have followed my campaign because of what ive been hearing because i have spent two months listening to people because i do think it important when you want to represent the entire country you actually listen to what happening in people lives  and substance abuse and addiction is ravaging families all over the country  and i heard it first in iowa  and then as soon as i got to new hampshire i was sitting down in keene new hampshire talking to some people first thing a retired doctor said what are you going to do about the heroin epidemic in new hampshire
 
im first of all going to talk a lot about it because we need to drag it out of the shadows we need to hold it up to the light    and it is heartbreaking because there has not been an event ive gone to where somebody hasnt come up to me sometimes bravely like you did in public and sometimes just privately taking me aside to talk to me about it that and mental health problems that go untreated   
 
so i would say three things  first i think youre very brave and very loving to take on this responsibility    and you should know that every time you think about how hard it is and your grandchildren will be really better off because their grandmother stepped in and said im here for you and i will take care of you  
 
secondly we have to extend every program every tax break everything we do to people taking care of kids whether they are parents or they are grandparents or maybe in some cases older siblings or aunts or uncles because of the inability of a child parents to be able to do so  so whatever i propose you will be eligible for people who are taking care of their grandchildren  
 
right now you cant get any help in most places and we have to change that we have to face the reality  i mean when youre -- look we were just laughing about my eight-month-old is beginning to heave herself around in the resemblance of a crawl  but once she takes off and were chasing her around and trying to keep her hands out of the outlets and all the things you have to do with little kids grandparents who are raising their kids and there are millions of them need more help
 
when i was a senator i championed a program in new york city to have a special form of housing for grandmothers raising their kids because they needed in my view the support of a community because it can be really isolating  most of your friends theyre not raising babies toddlers or school-age kids  so you need the support of a broader community to help you with that  and you need the support that any parent would get because that what youre doing  youre parenting
 
so i can tell you that i will do everything i can both in any benefit that i think the country should extend to raising children you will be eligible but also to the idea of how do we provide support for you and for other grandmothers because it predominantly grandmothers  there are some grandfathers predominantly grandmothers too
 
 
sec hillary clinton  you have half-a-dozen friends
 
 
sec hillary clinton  no i mean who are raising their children  yes and do you support each other
 
 
sec hillary clinton  okay  that important  you need to support each other because you need to get that emotional support and the hints and the tips like somebody finds out something that will work for them it may work for you  so thank you for raising that and thank you for saying that
 
 
next question over here
 
 
sec hillary clinton  well this is one of the key issues about how we do more to adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid because kids learn differently  some kids can sit there and absorb the teacher lessons  some kids need to move  some kids need to have practical experience  and i do think we have erred in trying to channel every kid into one form of learning  and i dont think that -- i dont think that works for every kid and especially for kids who are hyperactive kids who need to be channeled and directed but also need to be able to get rid of some of that extra energy that theyve got
 
i dont know how you expect to eliminate everything from recess to gym to extra-curricular activities during the school day and not have a lot of kids unable to concentrate and a lot of kids unable to really absorb the lessons youre trying to teach  so the specific issue about adhd kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment because we are medicating lots of kids  and i think we have to ask ourselves are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated and the answer is yes some do no doubt about it but are we medicating kids because weve not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs  and that starts in the family because it hard for a lot of families but it also goes into the schools
 
so part of what i will be talking about in the campaign is how do we get our schools and doing so by respecting our teachers who are on the front lines of trying to help kids --  -- and trying to figure out how works for different kinds of kids  and i dont think a cookie cutter approach works  i want every kid to do well in school  i want every kid to get the skills that that kid needs  i think we made an error when we eliminated in high school in most high schools technical education what we used to call vocational education    i think there are -- were going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs by people who can do work that is not just academic work  it is work that they learned to do by doing
 
and then i was in a community college here new hampshire technical institute talking to the people there and there were students who were taking courses who were in high school  that one way of doing it having kind of a group of high schools send their kids to a technical institute if theyre interested  i went to one in iowa where young kids were learning how to be machinists  they were juniors and seniors in high school  and the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up starting to pay like $40000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist  well we need to make that available for more kids
 
and look im not a scientist  laughter  but unlike a lot of the candidates on the other side i actually listen to scientists  laughter/  and one of the things that i will try to do by partnering not by mandating and directing out partnering with our educators partnering with people who have experience like our folks here is to figure out okay how do we get more hands-on learning because i do believe that for kids especially adhd kids doing something not trying to sit still which is really hard but getting up and learning going from machine to machine to figure out how it works if that their interest  so were going to take a hard look at all of that
 
but education is a local and state matter but i think if we do a better job looking at all the research about what actually produces the best results then we can come up with some incentive programs and some encouragement that will begin to try once again to get our education system to respond to the real needs that a whole variety of kids have
 
 
 
sec hillary clinton  here comes the mike
 
 
sec hillary clinton  yes
 
 
sec hillary clinton  education has been principally a state responsibility and a local responsibility  and it really wasnt until 30 50 years ago really i guess back in the 1960s when the government began to put in a lot more money from the federal government into education  and the original idea behind the federal government putting money in was to try to equalize spending so that kids in poor districts would have a better chance to get the same resources and the same quality of teachers and all that which i think is still very important  so that it was an equity argument some of you know title 1  the elementary secondary education act was really designed to do that
 
then in the reagan administration i think it was 19 -- i want to remember here 83 or so there was a report that came out called a nation at risk  and it compared our educational outcomes with comparable countries mostly european some asian and basically said you know our kids are not keeping up theyre not performing  and that was really a big change the reagan administration began saying okay well the federal government has to do more to try to change the way were educating and that went on and certainly president george w bush with no child left behind it was certainly well-motivated  i was in the senate  i know the arguments that were made  and it was to try to create a system where no matter who you were where you went to school youd have the same expectations about how you were going to achieve
 
now i say all of this because weve always spent money on our military depending upon who is in and who is out greater or lesser amounts but always the biggest part of the budget other than social security medicare et cetera  so i think that your question is a fair one like what are our priorities  we will always have to have the strongest best equipped military but even there we have to save money we have to be smart about it  we have to look for ways to get more done efficiently  and just like every other part of government it needs to be looked at hard so that we dont just send money without getting the results that we need  and there are a lot of issues in procurement and in other areas around military equipment and expenditures that really need to be cleaned up streamlined and made less expensive without sacrificing quality
 
so i think that it time in our country and in my speech on saturday i said we have to reform our government  we have to take a hard look at everything  we have to bring it into the 21st century  now our military equipment is 22nd century  i mean it more advanced than anybody anywhere  but were also fighting wars where a lot of what weve paid a lot of money for is no longer applicable  i mean were dealing with different kinds of threats  were dealing with cyber-threats  were dealing with irregular warfare and terrorism  so weve got to adjust how we fund even defense but we have to always fund it to the extent that we need to get the outcomes were looking for
 
but on education weve put more federal dollars in but to go back to the question about adhd we need to take a hard look about what working and what not working  i just want to give you -- im going to roll out a whole education proposal too but im going to give you a quick understanding of what i mean  everybody believes and im guilty of this that were an expert about education because we went to school  and those of us who are parents we had kids in school so we think weve got it all figured out  we know what worked or didnt work for us and therefore we kind of translate that into what will or wont work for other people
 
look there a lot of truth to that  people -- your experience matters and how you experienced school matters  but i think research really counts  so there a team of researchers i know theyre based at harvard but other schools have been involved and they went through all of the work that been done  they said okay what makes for a great school  and they came out with some things that are simple but hard to do and hard to pay for things like a longer school year particularly for disadvantaged kids  we have so much research it matters because for many of us in this room summer time you give your kids new experiences maybe they go to the y camp  i was talking to one of the people here who runs the camps  maybe you take them on trips where they go to museums  but for a lot of kids they actually lose learning over the summer
 
so here the teachers have worked and worked and parents have reinforced the messages in many instances then they lose ground  so they start the school year a little behind in some areas than where they ended the school year  so a longer school year for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense
 
a longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense because if you have kids particularly in the preteen early teen years and they get out of school before parents get home from work that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble and all kinds of trouble and bad influences  well you know the parents are working oftentimes again they have no options so longer day longer school day
 
more support for preparing for teachers so that they can share what works with each other  now that sounds so simple but it is so critical  okay what worked in your classroom  i tried this lesson it didnt work let take another look at it  and what weve done instead is to disempower experienced teachers and instead basically try to lay on top of tem all of these tests and all of these standards  i believe in both always have but you can get to a point of diminishing returns  too many and really all youre doing is like running on the hamster wheel instead of figuring out what does this kid need  what the diagnosis for this kids problem  how do we deal with it
 
and then finally let not forget the role that parents play and families play in helping a kid succeed in school  so having more interaction between the school and the home even if it a phone call even if it an e-mail exchange even better if it regular visits because if parents dont understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they dont reinforce it it really hard for teachers to make that case
 
so i think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at the state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference  and im very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity  they dont have sports teams anymore  they dont have bands  they dont have plays  they dont have a lot of the things that you remember from school and that for many kids gave them their first taste of success
 
so when you cut out all of those programs and you just say youve got to do well on these tests that are taught in a certain way to be learned in a certain way a lot of kids are not going to be able to grasp that and do well  but if you give them more options more responsibility and more support for those places that need it then i think we can get better outcomes personally as well as academically  so that what i want to see us do more of  
 
 
 
sec hillary clinton  excellent
 

 
sec hillary clinton  you make a great point  if people are really interested in following up on the points that she made we dont compare ourselves to china  but it is stressing to me when china invests in preschool opportunities for kids and we dont because if you look at the highest performing nations finland is usually at the top  they have early childhood education  they have paid leave  they have support for families  and yes they dont start school until kids are seven but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves  theyve been in organized settings predominantly family-based but not exclusively
 
and if you look at the other countries the best comparisons are to what are called the oecd countries  so if youre interested in googling that and looking they do a very thorough educational survey every few years and they lay out what working and what not working
 
and i absolutely agree that creativity you cannot expect kids to be creative if you dont let them play  now playing is a learning experience and in preschool it should be in kindergarten is should be    that doesnt mean they cant be learning at the same time
 
and this debate that were having seems to me to be so beside the point  it not like either play or learn through play that is supervised in preschool you will learn if it done right  that why we want quality preschool right  and so it a way of unleashing creativity and allowing little kids personalities to develop
 
in the classroom where i just was i was handed this book of drawings  each of the kids did a drawing about what they want to be when they grow up  and they want to be a firefighter  they want to be an artist  they want to be a vet  they want to be hairstylist  i mean it was everything you could imagine  but that the beginning of them thinking about envisioning adulthood
 
so the teachers here they look at that and theyll talk about what it would mean to be a vet or gee why do you want to be a hairstylist what does that mean to you or what kind of artist do you want to be  that is just as important as anything else you can do in the classroom  and so i think that the reaction against all the testing is coming from people who believe that we have to hold accountable what happens in our school we cant just say it doesnt matter whether kids learn anything  that not acceptable
 
but we have to get back to thinking about the different ways kids learn and creativity -- the best gift you can give a child is a creative open learning mind that will enable that child to pursue his or her own dreams to live up to his or her own god-given potential  and that potential may / may not at all be the same by anybody else
 
so i want to give our two guests if i can the chance for the last word because theyve been on the front lines


 thank you  oh thank you all  thank you so very very much   
 
it is wonderful to be here with all of you 
 
to be in new york  with my family with so many friends including many new yorkers who gave me the honor of serving them in the senate for eight years   
 
to be right across the water from the headquarters of the united nations where i represented our country many times   
 
to be here in this beautiful park dedicated to franklin roosevelt enduring vision of america the nation we want to be
 
and in a place… with absolutely no ceilings   
 
you know president roosevelt four freedoms are a testament to our nation unmatched aspirations and a reminder of our unfinished work at home and abroad  his legacy lifted up a nation and inspired presidents who followed  one is the man i served as secretary of state barack obama   and another is my husband bill clinton   
 
two democrats guided by the -- cheering  oh that will make him so happy  they were and are two democrats guided by the fundamental american belief that real and lasting prosperity must be built by all and shared by all   
 
president roosevelt called on every american to do his or her part and every american answered  he said there no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous america equality of opportunity… jobs for those who can work… security for those who need it… the ending of special privilege for the few…   the preservation of civil liberties for all…   a wider and constantly rising standard of living73 
 
that still sounds good to me   
 
it america basic bargain  if you do your part you ought to be able to get ahead  and when everybody does their part america gets ahead too 
 
that bargain inspired generations of families including my own 
 
it what kept my grandfather going to work in the same scranton lace mill every day for 50 years 
 
it what led my father to believe that if he scrimped and saved his small business printing drapery fabric in chicago could provide us with a middle-class life  and it did
 
when president clinton honored the bargain we had the longest peacetime expansion in history a balanced budget   and the first time in decades we all grew together with the bottom 20 percent of workers increasing their incomes by the same percentage as the top 5 percent   
 
when president obama honored the bargain we pulled back from the brink of depression saved the auto industry provided health care to 16 million working people   and replaced the jobs we lost faster than after a financial crash
 
but it not 1941 or 1993 or even 2009  we face new challenges in our economy and our democracy
 
we’re still working our way back from a crisis that happened because time-tested values were replaced by false promises 
 
instead of an economy built by every american for every american we were told that if we let those at the top pay lower taxes and bend the rules their success would trickle down to everyone else  jeers booing
 
what happened
 
well instead of a balanced budget with surpluses that could have eventually paid off our national debt the republicans twice cut taxes for the wealthiest borrowed money from other countries to pay for two wars and family incomes dropped  you know where we ended up
 
except it wasn’t the end 
 
as we have since our founding americans made a new beginning
 
you worked extra shifts took second jobs postponed home repairs you figured out how to make it work  and now people are beginning to think about their future again – going to college starting a business buying a house finally being able to put away something for retirement 
 
so we’re standing again  but we all know we’re not yet running the way america should 
 
you see corporations making record profits with ceos making record pay but your paychecks have barely budged 
 
while many of you are working multiple jobs to make ends meet you see the top 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of america kindergarten teachers combined  and often paying a lower tax rate
 
so you have to wonder when does my hard work pay off when does my family get ahead73
when73
 
i say now   
 
prosperity can’t be just for ceos and hedge fund managers
 
democracy can’t be just for billionaires and corporations  
 
prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain too
 
you brought our country back
 
now it time -- your time to secure the gains and move ahead
 
and you know what 
 
america can’t succeed unless you succeed  
 
that is why i am running for president of the united states    chanting
 
here on roosevelt island i believe we have a continuing rendezvous with destiny  each american and the country we cherish 
 
i’m running to make our economy work for you and for every american 
 
for the successful and the struggling 
 
for the innovators and inventors 
 
for those breaking barriers in technology and discovering cures for diseases
 
for the factory workers and food servers who stand on their feet all day   
 
for the nurses who work the night shift   
 
for the truckers who drive for hours and the farmers who feed us   
 
for the veterans who served our country 
 
for the small business owners who took a risk 
 
for everyone who ever been knocked down but refused to be knocked out   
 
i’m not running for some americans but for all americans   
 
our country challenges didn’t begin with the great recession and they won’t end with the recovery 
 
for decades americans have been buffeted by powerful currents 
 
advances in technology and the rise of global trade have created whole new areas of economic activity and opened new markets for our exports but they have also displaced jobs and undercut wages for millions of americans 
 
the financial industry and many multi-national corporations have created huge wealth for a few by focusing too much on short-term profit and too little on long-term value… too much on complex trading schemes and stock buybacks too little on investments in new businesses jobs and fair compensation   
 
our political system is so paralyzed by gridlock and dysfunction that most americans have lost confidence that anything can actually get done  and they’ve lost trust in the ability of both government and big business to change course
 
now we can blame historic forces beyond our control for some of this but the choices we’ve made as a nation leaders and citizens alike have also played a big role
 
our next president must work with congress and every other willing partner across our entire country  and i will do just that --   to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us 
 
at our best that what americans do   we’re problem solvers not deniers  we don’t hide from change we harness it   
 
but we can’t do that if we go back to the top-down economic policies that failed us before 
 
americans have come too far to see our progress ripped away 
 
now there may be some new voices in the presidential republican choir laughter but they’re all singing the same old song 
 
a song called yesterday73  laughter  
 
you know the one -- all our troubles look as though they’re here to stay laughter… and we need a place to hide away… they believe in yesterday
 
and you’re lucky i didn’t try singing that too ill tell you  laughter  
 
these republicans trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse
 
we’ve heard this tune before  and we know how it turns out 
 
ask many of these candidates about climate change one of the defining threats of our time   and they’ll say  i’m not a scientist73  laughter  well then why don’t they start listening to those who are   
 
they pledge to wipe out tough rules on wall street rather than rein in the banks that are still too risky courting future failures  in a case that can only be considered mass amnesia
 
they want to take away health insurance from more than 16 million americans without offering any credible alternative  booing
 
they shame and blame women rather than respect our right to make our own reproductive health decisions  
 
they want to put immigrants who work hard and pay taxes at risk of deportation  booing
 
and they turn their backs on gay people who love each other   
 
fundamentally they reject what it takes to build an inclusive economy  it takes an inclusive society     what i once called a village73  that has a place for everyone
 
now my values and a lifetime of experiences have given me a different vision for america
i believe that success isn’t measured by how much the wealthiest americans have but by how many children climb out of poverty  
 
how many start-ups and small businesses open and thrive…
 
how many young people go to college without drowning in debt…  
 
how many people find a good job…
 
how many families get ahead and stay ahead
 
i didn’t learn this from politics  i learned it from my own family
 
my mother taught me that everybody needs a chance and a champion  she knew what it was like not to have either one
 
her own parents abandoned her and by 14 she was out on her own working as a housemaid  years later when i was old enough to understand i asked what kept her going 
 
you know what her answer was  something very simple  kindness from someone who believed she mattered 
 
the 1st grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and without embarrassing her brought extra food to share
 
the woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done  that was a bargain she leapt to accept
 
and because some people believed in her she believed in me   
 
that why i believe with all my heart in america and in the potential of every american
 
to meet every challenge
 
to be resilient… no matter what the world throws at you
 
to solve the toughest problems
 
i believe we can do all these things because i’ve seen it happen
 
as a young girl i signed up at my methodist church to babysit the children of mexican farmworkers while their parents worked in the fields on the weekends  and later as a law student i advocated for congress to require better working and living conditions for farm workers whose children deserved better opportunities   
 
my first job out of law school was for the children defense fund     i walked door-to-door to find out how many children with disabilities couldn’t go to school and to help build the case for a law guaranteeing them access to education   
 
as a leader of the legal services corporation i defended the right of poor people to have a lawyer  and saw lives changed because an abusive marriage ended or an illegal eviction stopped
 
in arkansas i supervised law students who represented clients in courts and prisons organized scholarships for single parents going to college led efforts for better schools and health care and personally knew the people whose lives were improved
 
as senator i had the honor of representing brave firefighters police officers emts construction workers and volunteers   who ran toward danger on 9/11 and stayed there becoming sick themselves 
 
it took years of effort but congress finally approved the health care they needed  
 
there are so many faces and stories that i carry with me of people who gave their best and then needed help themselves
 
just weeks ago i met another person like that a single mom juggling a job and classes at community college while raising three kids
 
she doesn’t expect anything to come easy  but she did ask me what more can be done so it isn’t quite so hard for families like hers 
 
i want to be her champion and your champion   
 
if you’ll give me the chance i’ll wage and win four fights for you
 
the first is to make the economy work for everyday americans not just those at the top   
 
to make the middle class mean something again with rising incomes and broader horizons  and to give the poor a chance to work their way into it  
 
the middle class needs more growth and more fairness  growth and fairness go together  for lasting prosperity you can’t have one without the other
 
is this possible in today world crowd responds 
 
i believe it is or i wouldn’t be standing here   
 
do i think it will be easy  of course not
 
but here the good news  there are allies for change everywhere who know we can’t stand by while inequality increases wages stagnate and the promise of america dims  we should welcome the support of all americans who want to go forward together with us   
 
there are public officials who know americans need a better deal 
 
business leaders who want higher pay for employees equal pay for women   and no discrimination against the lgbt community either   
 
there are leaders of finance who want less short-term trading and more long-term investing 
 
there are union leaders who are investing their own pension funds in putting people to work to build tomorrow economy    we need everyone to come to the table and work with us
 
in the coming weeks i’ll propose specific policies to
 
reward businesses who invest in long term value rather than the quick buck – because that leads to higher growth for the economy higher wages for workers and yes bigger profits everybody will have a better time
 
i will rewrite the tax code so it rewards hard work and investments here at home not quick trades or stashing profits overseas   
 
i will give new incentives to companies that give their employees a fair share of the profits their hard work earns   
 
we will unleash a new generation of entrepreneurs and small business owners by providing tax relief cutting red tape and making it easier to get a small business loan 
 
we will restore america to the cutting edge of innovation science and research by increasing both public and private investments   
 
and we will make america the clean energy superpower of the 21st century   
 
developing renewable power – wind solar advanced biofuels…
 
building cleaner power plants smarter electric grids greener buildings…
 
using additional fees and royalties from fossil fuel extraction to protect the environment…  
 
and ease the transition for distressed communities to a more diverse and sustainable economic future from coal country to indian country from small towns in the mississippi delta to the rio grande valley to our inner cities we have to help our fellow americans   
 
now this will create millions of jobs and countless new businesses and enable america to lead the global fight against climate change   
 
we will also connect workers to their jobs and businesses  customers will have a better chance to actually get where they need and get what they desire with roads railways bridges airports ports and broadband brought up to global standards for the 21st century   
 
we will establish an infrastructure bank and sell bonds to pay for some of these improvements
 
now building an economy for tomorrow also requires investing in our most important asset our people beginning with our youngest   
 
that why i will propose that we make preschool and quality childcare available to every child in america   
 
and i want you to remember this because to me this is absolutely the most-compelling argument why we should do this  research tells us how much early learning in the first five years of life can impact lifelong success  in fact 80 percent of the brain is developed by age three 
 
one thing i’ve learned is that talent is universal – you can find it anywhere – but opportunity is not     too many of our kids never have the chance to learn and thrive as they should and as we need them to 
 
our country won’t be competitive or fair if we don’t help more families give their kids the best possible start in life 
 
so let staff our primary and secondary schools with teachers who are second to none in the world and receive the respect they deserve for sparking the love of learning in every child   
 
let make college affordable and available to all …and lift the crushing burden of student debt   
 
let provide lifelong learning for workers to gain or improve skills the economy requires setting up many more americans for success
 
now the second fight is to strengthen america families because when our families are strong america is strong
 
and today families face new and unique pressures  parents need more support and flexibility to do their job at work and at home  
 
i believe you should have the right to earn paid sick days  
 
i believe you should receive your work schedule with enough notice to arrange childcare or take college courses to get ahead   
 
i believe you should look forward to retirement with confidence not anxiety 
 
that you should have the peace of mind that your health care will be there when you need it without breaking the bank   
 
i believe we should offer paid family leave   so no one has to choose between keeping a paycheck and caring for a new baby or a sick relative  
 
and it is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job   -- and women of color often making even less   
 
this isn’t a women issue  it a family issue  just like raising the minimum wage is a family issue     expanding childcare is a family issue  declining marriage rates is a family issue  the unequal rates of incarceration is a family issue     helping more people with an addiction or a mental health problem get help is a family issue   
 
in america every family should feel like they belong 
 
so we should offer hard-working law-abiding immigrant families a path to citizenship    not second-class status   
 
and we should ban discrimination against lgbt americans and their families   so they can live learn marry and work just like everybody else   
 
you know america diversity our openness our devotion to human rights and freedom is what drawn so many to our shores  what inspired people all over the world  i know  i’ve seen it with my own eyes 
 
and these are also qualities that prepare us well for the demands of a world that is more interconnected than ever before
 
so we have a third fight to harness all of america power smarts and values to maintain our leadership for peace security and prosperity
 
no other country on earth is better positioned to thrive in the 21st century  no other country is better equipped to meet traditional threats from countries like russia north korea and iran – and to deal with the rise of new powers like china 
 
no other country is better prepared to meet emerging threats from cyber attacks transnational terror networks like isis and diseases that spread across oceans and continents
 
as your president i’ll do whatever it takes to keep americans safe   
 
and if you look over my left shoulder you can see the new world trade center soaring skyward   
 
as a senator from new york i dedicated myself to getting our city and state the help we needed to recover  and as a member of the armed services committee i worked to maintain the best-trained best-equipped strongest military ready for today threats and tomorrow 
 
and when our brave men and women come home from war or finish their service i’ll see to it that they get not just the thanks of a grateful nation but the care and benefits they’ve earned   
 
i’ve stood up to adversaries like putin and reinforced allies like israel  i was in the situation room on the day we got bin laden   
 
but i know -- i know we have to be smart as well as strong 
 
meeting today global challenges requires every element of america power including skillful diplomacy economic influence and building partnerships to improve lives around the world with people not just their governments
 
there are a lot of trouble spots in the world but there a lot of good news out there too 
 
i believe the future holds far more opportunities than threats if we exercise creative and confident leadership that enables us to shape global events rather than be shaped by them   
 
and we all know that in order to be strong in the world though we first have to be strong at home  that why we have to win the fourth fight – reforming our government and revitalizing our democracy so that it works for everyday americans    
 
we have to stop the endless flow of secret unaccountable money that is distorting our elections corrupting our political process and drowning out the voices of our people   
 
we need justices on the supreme court who will protect every citizen right to vote   rather than every corporation right to buy elections   
 
if necessary i will support a constitutional amendment to undo the supreme court decision in citizens united   
 
i want to make it easier for every citizen to vote  that why ive proposed universal automatic registration and expanded early voting   
 
i’ll fight back against republican efforts to disempower and disenfranchise young people poor people people with disabilities and people of color   
 
what part of democracy are they afraid of   
 
no matter how easy we make it to vote we still have to give americans something worth voting for   
 
government is never going to have all the answers – but it has to be smarter simpler more efficient and a better partner 
 
that means access to advanced technology so government agencies can more effectively serve their customers the american people 
 
we need expertise and innovation from the private sector to help cut waste and streamline services
 
there so much that works in america  for every problem we face someone somewhere in america is solving it  silicon valley cracked the code on sharing and scaling a while ago  many states are pioneering new ways to deliver services  i want to help washington catch up   
 
to do that we need a political system that produces results by solving problems that hold us back not one overwhelmed by extreme partisanship and inflexibility 
 
now i’ll always seek common ground with friend and opponent alike  but i’ll also stand my ground when i must   
 
that something i did as senator and secretary of state -- whether it was working with republicans to expand health care for children and for our national guard or improve our foster care and adoption system or pass a treaty to reduce the number of russian nuclear warheads that could threaten our cities -- and it something i will always do as your president
 
we americans may differ bicker stumble and fall but we are at our best when we pick each other up when we have each other back 
 
like any family our american family is strongest when we cherish what we have in common and fight back against those who would drive us apart
 
people all over the world have asked me how could you and president obama work together after you fought so hard against each other in that long campaign73 
 
now that is an understandable question considering that in many places if you lose an election you could get imprisoned or exiled – even killed – not hired as secretary of state   
 
but president obama asked me to serve and i accepted because we both love our country     that how we do it in america
 
with that same spirit together we can win these four fights 
 
we can build an economy where hard work is rewarded
 
we can strengthen our families
 
we can defend our country and increase our opportunities all over the world
 
and we can renew the promise of our democracy
 
if we all do our part  in our families in our businesses unions houses of worship schools and yes in the voting booth 
 
i want you to join me in this effort  help me build this campaign and make it your own 
 
talk to your friends your family your neighbors
 
text join73 j-o-i-n to 4-7-2-4-6
 
go to hillaryclintoncom and sign up to make calls and knock on doors   
 
it no secret that we’re going up against some pretty powerful forces that will do and spend whatever it takes to advance a very different vision for america  but i’ve spent my life fighting for children families and our country  and i’m not stopping now    chanting
 
you know i know how hard this job is  i’ve seen it up close and personal  laughter
 
all our presidents come into office looking so vigorous laughter  and then we watch their hair grow grayer and grayer 
 
well i may not be the youngest candidate in this race  but i will be the youngest woman president in the history of the united states   
 
and the first grandmother as well   
 
and one additional advantage   you’re won’t see my hair turn white in the white house  i’ve been coloring it for years   
 
so i’m looking forward to a great debate among democrats republicans and independents  i’m not running to be a president only for those americans who already agree with me  i want to be a president for all americans
 
and along the way ill just let you in on this little secret  laughter  i won’t get everything right  lord knows i’ve made my share of mistakes  well there no shortage of people pointing them out  laughter 
 
and i certainly haven’t won every battle i’ve fought  but leadership means perseverance and hard choices  you have to push through the setbacks and disappointments and keep at it   
 
i think you know by now that i’ve been called many things by many people laughter -- quitter73 is not one of them   
 
like so much else in my life i got this from my mother
 
when i was a girl she never let me back down from any bully or barrier  in her later years mom lived with us and she was still teaching me the same lessons  i’d come home from a hard day at the senate or the state department sit down with her at the small table in our breakfast nook and just let everything pour out  and she would remind me why we keep fighting even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce 
 
i can still hear her saying life not about what happens to you it about what you do with what happens to you – so get back out there73   
 
she lived to be 92 years old and i often think about all the battles she witnessed over the course of the last century -- all the progress that was won because americans refused to give up or back down  
 
she was born on june 4 1919 -- before women in america had the right to vote  but on that very day after years of struggle congress passed the constitutional amendment that would change that forever
 
the story of america is a story of hard-fought hard-won progress  and it continues today  new chapters are being written by men and women who believe that all of us – not just some but all – should have the chance to live up to our god-given potential 
 
not only because we’re a tolerant country or a generous country or a compassionate country but because we’re a better stronger more prosperous country when we harness the talent hard work and ingenuity of every single american 
 
i wish my mother could have been with us longer  i wish she could have seen chelsea become a mother herself  i wish she could have met charlotte
 
i wish she could have seen the america we’re going to build together   
 
an america where if you do your part you reap the rewards
 
where we don’t leave anyone out or anyone behind
 
an america where a father can tell his daughter  yes you can be anything you want to be  even president of the united states  
 
thank you all  god bless you  and may god bless america  

during remarks at the 18th annual david n dinkins leadership and public policy forum hillary clinton outlined the criminal justice challenges we face today including in baltimore and the first ideas on solutions to meet them

hillary called for innovative solutions by changing the way we approach punishment and prison saying saying it time to end the era of mass incarceration73 she also addressed the need for innovative strategies to fight crime and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they represent including body cameras for every police department in the country

 

full text of the remarks as delivered are available below

thank you so much i am absolutely delighted to be back here at columbia i want to thank president bollinger dean janow and everyone at the school of international and public affairs it is a special treat to be here with and on behalf of a great leader of this city and our country david dinkins he has made such an indelible impact on new york and i had the great privilege of working with him as first lady and then of course as a new senator

when i was just starting out as a senator david door was always open he and his wonderful wife joyce were great friends and supporters and good sounding boards about ideas that we wanted to consider to enhance the quality of life and the opportunities for the people of this city i was pleased to address the dinkins leadership and public policy forum in my first year as a senator and i so appreciated then as i have in the years since david generosity with his time and most of all his wisdom so 14 years later i’m honored to have this chance once again to help celebrate the legacy of one of new york greatest public servants

i’m pleased too that you will have the opportunity after my remarks to hear from such a distinguished panel to go into more detail about some of the issues that we face i also know that manhattan borough president gail brewer is here along with other local and community leaders

because surely this is a time when our collective efforts to devise approaches to the problems that still afflict us is more important than ever indeed it is a time for wisdom

for yet again the family of a young black man is grieving a life cut short

yet again the streets of an american city are marred by violence by shattered glass and shouts of anger and shows of force

yet again a community is reeling its fault lines laid bare and its bonds of trust and respect frayed

yet again brave police officers have been attacked in the line of duty

what we’ve seen in baltimore should indeed does tear at our soul  

and from ferguson to staten island to baltimore the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable

walter scott shot in the back in charleston south carolina unarmed in debt and terrified of spending more time in jail for child support payments he couldn’t afford

tamir rice shot in a park in cleveland ohio unarmed and just 12 years old

eric garner choked to death after being stopped for selling cigarettes on the streets of this city

and now freddie gray his spine nearly severed while in police custody

not only as a mother and a grandmother but as a citizen a human being my heart breaks for these young men and their families  

we have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in america

there is something profoundly wrong when african american men are still far more likely to be stopped and searched by police charged with crimes and sentenced to longer prison terms than are meted out to their white counterparts

there is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes and an estimated 15 million black men are missing73 from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death

there is something wrong when more than one out of every three young black men in baltimore can’t find a job

there is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down as far as it has in many of our communities

we have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance and these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again

we should begin by heeding the pleas of freddie gray family for peace and unity echoing the families of michael brown trayvon martin and others in the past years  

those who are instigating further violence in baltimore are disrespecting the gray family and the entire community they are compounding the tragedy of freddie gray death and setting back the cause of justice so the violence has to stop

but more broadly let remember that everyone in every community benefits when there is respect for the law and when everyone in every community is respected by the law that is what we have to work towards in baltimore and across our country

we must urgently begin to rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among americans  between police and citizens yes but also across society

restoring trust in our politics our press our markets between and among neighbors and even people with whom we disagree politically

this is so fundamental to who we are as a nation and everything we want to achieve together

it truly is about how we treat each other and what we value making it possible for every american to reach his or her god-given potential—regardless of who you are where you were born or who you love

the inequities that persist in our justice system undermine this shared vision of what america can be and should be

i learned this firsthand as a young attorney just out of law school—at one of those law schools that will remain nameless here at columbia one of my earliest jobs for the children defense fund which david had mentioned—i was so fortunate to work with marian wright edelman as a young lawyer and then serving on the board of the children defense fund—was studying the problem then of youth teenagers sometimes preteens incarcerated in adult jails then as director of the university of arkansas school of law legal aid clinic i advocated on behalf of prison inmates and poor families  

i saw repeatedly how our legal system can be and all too often is stacked against those who have the least power who are the most vulnerable  

i saw how families could be and were torn apart by excessive incarceration i saw the toll on children growing up in homes shattered by poverty and prison

so unfortunately i know these are not new challenges by any means

in fact they have become even more complex and urgent over time and today they demand fresh thinking and bold action from all of us

today there seems to be a growing bipartisan movement for commonsense reforms in our criminal justice systems senators as disparate on the political spectrum as cory booker and rand paul and dick durbin and mike lee are reaching across the aisle to find ways to work together it is rare to see democrats and republicans agree on anything today but we’re beginning to agreeing on this we need to restore balance to our criminal justice system

now of course it is not enough just to agree and give speeches about it—we actually have to work together to get the job done

we need to deliver real reforms that can be felt on our streets in our courthouses and our jails and prisons in communities too long neglected

let me touch on two areas in particular where i believe we need to push for more progress

first we need smart strategies to fight crime that help restore trust between law enforcement and our communities especially communities of color

there a lot of good work to build on across the country there are so many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence honorably doing their duty putting themselves on the line to save lives there are police departments already deploying creative and effective strategies demonstrating how we can protect the public without resorting to unnecessary force we need to learn from those examples build on what works

we can start by making sure that federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets

president obama task force on policing gives us a good place to start its recommendations offer a roadmap for reform from training to technology guided by more and better data

we should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects  

that will improve transparency and accountability it will help protect good people on both sides of the lens for every tragedy caught on tape there surely have been many more that remained invisible not every problem can be or will be prevented with cameras but this is a commonsense step we should take

the president has provided the idea of matching funds to state and local governments investing in body cameras we should go even further and make this the norm everywhere

and we should listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime rather than measuring success just by the number of arrests or convictions  

as your senator from new york i supported a greater emphasis on community policing along with putting more officers on the street to get to know those communities

david dinkins was an early pioneer of this policy his leadership helped lay the foundation for dramatic drops in crime in the years that followed

and today smart policing in communities that builds relationships partnerships and trust makes more sense than ever  

and it shouldn’t be limited just to officers on the beat it an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal justice system to prosecutors and parole officers to judges and lawmakers

we all share a responsibility to help re-stitch the fabric of our neighborhoods and communities

we also have to be honest about the gaps that exist across our country the inequality that stalks our streets because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don’t talk about what needed to provide economic opportunity better educational chances for young people more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children 

today i saw an article on the front page of usa today that really struck me written by a journalist who lives in baltimore and here what i read three times to make sure i was reading correctly at a conference in 2013 at johns hopkins university vice provost jonathan bagger pointed out that only six miles separate the baltimore neighborhoods of roland park and hollins market

but there is a 20-year difference in the average life expectancy73 we have learned in the last few years that life expectancy which is a measure of the quality of life in communities and countries manifests the same inequality that we see in so many other parts of our society

women—white women without high school education—are losing life expectancy black men and black women are seeing their life expectancy goes down in so many parts of our country 

this may not grab headlines although i was glad to see it on the front page of usa today but it tells us more than i think we can bear about what we are up against 

we need to start understanding how important it is to care for every single child as though that child were our own 

david and i started our conversation this morning talking about our grandchildren now his are considerably older than mine but it was not just two longtime friends catching up with each other it was so clearly sharing what is most important to us as it is to families everywhere in our country

so i don’t want the discussion about criminal justice smart policing to be siloed and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that the conversation needs to be much broader because that is a symptom not a cause of what ails us today

the second area where we need to chart a new course is how we approach punishment and prison

it a stark fact that the united states has less than 5 percent of the world population yet we have almost 25 percent of the world total prison population the numbers today are much higher than they were 30 40 years ago despite the fact that crime is at historic lows

of the more than 2 million americans incarcerated today a significant percentage are low-level offenders people held for violating parole or minor drug crimes or who are simply awaiting trial in backlogged courts

keeping them behind bars does little to reduce crime but it is does a lot to tear apart families and communities

one in every 28 children now has a parent in prison think about what that means for those children

when we talk about one and a half million missing african american men we’re talking about missing husbands missing fathers missing brothers

they’re not there to look after their children or bring home a paycheck and the consequences are profound          

without the mass incarceration that we currently practice millions fewer people would be living in poverty 

and it not just families trying to stay afloat with one parent behind bars of the 600000 prisoners who reenter society each year roughly 60 percent face long-term unemployment

and for all this taxpayers are paying about $80 billion a year to keep so many people in prison

the price of incarcerating a single inmate is often more than $30000 per year—and up to $60000 in some states that the salary of a teacher or police officer

one year in a new jersey state prison costs $44000—more than the annual tuition at princeton 

if the united states brought our correctional expenditures back in line with where they were several decades ago we’d save an estimated $28 billion a year and i believe we would not be less safe you can pay a lot of police officers and nurses and others with $28 billion to help us deal with the pipeline issues

it time to change our approach it time to end the era of mass incarceration we need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe

i don’t know all the answers that why i’m here—to ask all the smart people in columbia and new york to start thinking this through with me i know we should work together to pursue together to pursue alternative punishments for low-level offenders they do have to be in some way registered in the criminal justice system but we don’t want that to be a fast track to long-term criminal activity we don’t want to create another incarceration generation73

i’ve been encouraged to see changes that i supported as senator to reduce the unjust federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine crimes finally become law  

and last year the sentencing commission reduced recommended prison terms for some drug crimes  

president obama and former attorney general holder have led the way with important additional steps and i am looking forward to our new attorney general loretta lynch carrying this work forward

there are other measures that i and so many others have championed to reform arbitrary mandatory minimum sentences are long overdue

we also need probation and drug diversion programs to deal swiftly with violations while allowing low-level offenders who stay clean and stay out of trouble to stay out of prison i’ve seen the positive effects of specialized drug courts and juvenile programs work to the betterment of individuals and communities and please please let us put mental health back at the top of our national agenda 

you and i know that the promise of de-institutionalizing those in mental health facilities was supposed to be followed by the creation of community-based treatment centers well we got half of that equation—but not the other half our prisons and our jails are now our mental health institutions

i have to tell you i was somewhat surprised in both iowa and new hampshire to be asked so many questions about mental health what are we going to do with people who need help for substance abuse or mental illness73 what are we going to do when the remaining facilities are being shut down for budget reasons73 what are we going to do when hospitals don’t really get reimbursed for providing the kind of emergency care that is needed for mental health patients73

it not just a problem in our cities there a quiet epidemic of substance abuse sweeping small-town and rural america as well we have to do more and finally get serious about treatment

i’ll be talking about all of this in the months to come offering new solutions to protect and strengthen our families and communities

i know in a time when we’re afflicted by short-termism we’re not looking over the horizon for the investments that we need to make in our fellow citizens in our children so i’m well aware that progress will not be easy despite the emerging bipartisan consensus for certain reforms and that we will have to overcome deep divisions and try to begin to replenish our depleted reservoirs of trust

but i am convinced as the congenital optimist i must be to live my life that we can rise to this challenge we can heal our wounds we can restore balance to our justice system and respect in our communities and we can make sure that we take actions that are going to make a difference in the lives of those who for too long have been marginalized and forgotten

let protect the rights of all our people let take on the broader inequities in our society you can’t separate out the unrest we see in the streets from the cycles of poverty and despair that hollow out those neighborhoods

despite all the progress we’ve made in this country lifting people up—and it has been extraordinary—too many of our fellow citizens are still left out

twenty-five years ago in his inaugural address as mayor david dinkins warned of leaving too many lost amidst the wealth and grandeur that surrounds us73

today his words and the emotion behind them ring truer than ever you don’t have to look too far from this magnificent hall to find children still living in poverty or trapped in failing schools families who work hard but can’t afford the rising prices in their neighborhood

mothers and fathers who fear for their sons’ safety when they go off to school—or just to go buy a pack of skittles

these challenges are all woven together and they all must be tackled together

our goal must truly be inclusive and lasting prosperity that measured by how many families get ahead and stay ahead…

how many children climb out of poverty and stay out of prison…

how many young people can go to college without breaking the bank…

how many new immigrants can start small businesses …

how many parents can get good jobs that allow them to balance the demands of work and family

that how we should measure prosperity with all due respect that is a far better measurement than the size of the bonuses handed out in downtown office buildings

now even in the most painful times like those we are seeing in baltimore …

when parents fear for their children…

when smoke fills the skies above our cities…

when police officers are assaulted…

even then—especially then—let remember the aspirations and values that unite us all that every person should have the opportunity to succeed that no one is disposable that every life matters

so yes mayor dinkins this is a time for wisdom

a time for honesty about race and justice in america   

and yes a time for reform

david dinkins is a leader we can look to we know what he stood for let us take the challenge and example he presents and think about what we must do to make sure that this country we love—this city we live in—are both good and great

and please join me in saying a prayer for the family of freddie gray and all the men whose names we know and those we don’t who have lost their lives unnecessarily and tragically and in particular today include in that prayer the people of baltimore and our beloved country

thank you all very much
