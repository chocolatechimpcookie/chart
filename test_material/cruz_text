cruz good to see you



thank you 

thank you so much president falwell god bless 



i am thrilled to join you today at the largest christian university in the world



today i want to talk with you about the promise of america

imagine your parents when they were children imagine a little girl growing up in wilmington delaware during world war ii the daughter of irish and italian catholic family working class her uncle ran numbers in wilmington she grew up with dozens of cousins because her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids she had a difficult father a man who drank far too much and frankly didn’t think that women should be educated

and yet this young girl pretty and shy was driven was bright was inquisitive and she became the first person in her family ever to go to college in 1956 my mom eleanor graduated from rice university with a degree in math and became a pioneering computer programmer in the 1950s and 1960s



imagine a teenage boy not much younger than many of you here today growing up in cuba jet black hair skinny as a rail



involved in student council and yet cuba was not at a peaceful time the dictator batista was corrupt he was oppressive and this teenage boy joins a revolution he joins a revolution against batista he begins fighting with other teenagers to free cuba from the dictator this boy at age 17 finds himself thrown in prison finds himself tortured beaten and then at age 18 he flees cuba he comes to america

imagine for a second the hope that was in his heart as he rode that ferry boat across to key west and got on a greyhound bus to head to austin texas to begin working washing dishes making 50 cents an hour coming to the one land on earth that has welcomed so many millions

when my dad came to america in 1957 he could not have imagined what lay in store for him imagine a young married couple living together in the 1970s neither one of them has a personal relationship with jesus they have a little boy and they are both drinking far too much they are living a fast life



when i was three my father decided to leave my mother and me we were living in calgary at the time he got on a plane and he flew back to texas and he decided he didn’t want to be married anymore and he didn’t want to be a father to his 3-year-old son and yet when he was in houston a friend a colleague from the oil and gas business invited him to a bible study invited him to clay road ph baptist church and there my father gave his life to jesus christ



and god transformed his heart and he drove to the airport he bough a plane ticket and he flew back to be with my mother and me



there are people who wonder if faith is real i can tell you in my family there not a second of doubt because were it not for the transformative love of jesus christ i would have been saved and i would have been raised by a single mom without my father in the household

imagine another little girl living in africa in kenya and nigeria that a diverse crowd



playing with kids they spoke swahili she spoke english coming back to california



where her parents who had been missionaries in africa raised her on the central coast she starts a small business when she in grade school baking bread she calls it heidi bakery she and her brother compete baking bread they bake thousands of loaves of bread and go to the local apple orchard where they sell the bread to people coming to pick apples she goes on to a career in business excelling and rising to the highest pinnacles and then heidi becomes my wife and my very best friend in the world



heidi becomes an incredible mom to our two precious little girls caroline and catherine the joys and loves of our life



imagine another teenage boy being raised in houston hearing stories from his dad about prison and torture in cuba hearing stories about how fragile liberty is beginning to study the united states constitution learning about the incredible protections we have in this country that protect the god-given liberty of every american experiencing challenges at home




in the 1980s oil prices crater and his parents business go bankrupt heading off to school over a thousand miles away from home in a place where he knew nobody where he was alone and scared and his parents going through bankruptcy meant there was no financial support at home so at the age of 17 he went to get two jobs to help pay his way through school

he took over $100000 in school loans loans i suspect a lot of ya’ll can relate to loans that i’ll point out i just paid off a few years ago



these are all of our stories these are who we are as americans

and yet for so many americans the promise of america seems more and more distant what is the promise of america the idea that -- the revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon which is that our rights don’t come from man they come from god almighty



and that the purpose of the constitution as thomas jefferson put it is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government



the incredible opportunity of the american dream what has enabled millions of people from all over the world to come to america with nothing and to achieve anything and then the american exceptionalism that has made this nation a clarion voice for freedom in the world a shining city on a hill

that the promise of america that is what makes this nation an indispensable nation a unique nation in the history of the world

and yet so many fear that that promise is today unattainable so many fear it is slipping away from our hands

i want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of america 240 years ago on this very day a 38-year-old lawyer named patrick henry



 stood up just a hundred miles from here in richmond virginia



 and said give me liberty or give me death

 i want to ask each of you to imagine imagine millions of courageous conservatives all across america rising up together to say in unison we demand our liberty

today roughly half of born again christians aren’t voting they’re staying home imagine instead millions of people of faith all across america coming out to the polls and voting our values



today millions of young people are scared worried about the future worried about what the future will hold imagine millions of young people coming together and standing together saying we will stand for liberty



think just how different the world would be imagine instead of economic stagnation booming economic growth



instead of small businesses going out of business in record numbers imagine small businesses growing and prospering imagine young people coming out of school with four five six job offers



imagine innovation thriving on the internet as government regulators and tax collectors are kept at bay and more and more opportunity is created



imagine america finally becoming energy self-sufficient as millions and millions of high-paying jobs are created



five years ago today the president signed obamacare into law

audience boo

within hours liberty university went to court filing a lawsuit to stop that failed law



instead of the joblessness instead of the millions forced into part-time work instead of the millions who’ve lost their health insurance lost their doctors have faced skyrocketing health insurance premiums imagine in 2017 a new president signing legislation repealing every word of obamacare



imagine health care reform that keeps government out of the way between you and your doctor and that makes health insurance personal and portable and affordable



instead of a tax code that crushes innovation that imposes burdens on families struggling to make ends met imagine a simple flat tax



 that lets every american fill out his or her taxes on a postcard



imagine abolishing the irs



instead of the lawlessness and the president unconstitutional executive amnesty imagine a president that finally finally finally secures the borders

click here for more information


and imagine a legal immigration system that welcomes and celebrates those who come to achieve the american dream



instead of a federal government that wages an assault on our religious liberty that goes after hobby lobby that goes after the little sisters of the poor that goes after liberty university imagine a federal government that stands for the first amendment rights of every american



instead of a federal government that works to undermine our values imagine a federal government that works to defend the sanctity of human life



 and to uphold the sacrament of marriage



instead of a government that works to undermine our second amendment rights that seeks to ban our ammunition



 imagine a federal government that protects the right to keep and bear arms of all law-abiding americans



instead of a government that seizes your e-mails and your cell phones imagine a federal government that protected the privacy rights of every american



instead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through common core



 imagine repealing every word of common core



imagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation



 that every single child regardless of race regardless of ethnicity regardless of wealth or zip code every child in america has the right to a quality education



and that true from all of the above whether is public schools or charter schools or private schools or christian schools or parochial schools or home schools every child



instead of a president who boycotts prime minister netanyahu imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of israel



instead of a president who seeks to go to the united nations to end-run congress and the american people

audience member that horrible

cruz  imagine a president who says i will honor the constitution and under no circumstances will iran be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon



imagine a president who says we will stand up and defeat radical islamic terrorism



 and we will call it by its name



audience member that right

cruz we will defend the united states of america



now all of these seem difficult indeed to some they may seem unimaginable and yet if you look in the history of our country imagine it 1775 and you and i were sitting there in richmond listening to patrick henry say give me liberty or give me death

imagine it 1776 and we were watching the 54 signers of the declaration of independence stand together and pledge their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor to igniting the promise of america

imagine it was 1777 and we were watching general washington as he lost battle after battle after battle in the freezing cold as his soldiers with no shoes were dying fighting for freedom against the most powerful army in the world that too seemed unimaginable

imagine it 1933 and we were listening to president franklin delano roosevelt tell america at a time of crushing depression at a time of a gathering storm abroad that we have nothing to fear but fear itself

imagine it 1979 and you and i were listening to ronald reagan



and he was telling us that we would cut the top marginal tax rates from 70 percent all the way down to 28 percent that we would go from crushing stagnation to booming economic growth to millions being lifted out of poverty and into prosperity abundance that the very day that he was sworn in our hostages who were languishing in iran would be released and that within a decade we would win the cold war and tear the berlin wall to the ground

that would have seemed unimaginable and yet with the grace of god that exactly what happened



from the dawn of this country at every stage america has enjoyed god providential blessing over and over again when we face impossible odds the american people rose to the challenge you know compared to that repealing obamacare and abolishing the irs ain’t all that tough



the power of the american people when we rise up and stand for liberty knows no bounds



if you’re ready to join a grassroots army across this nation coming together and standing for liberty i’m going to ask you to break a rule here today and to take out your cell phones and to text the word constitution to the number 33733 you can also text imagine we’re versatile

once again text constitution to 33733 god blessing has been on america from the very beginning of this nation and i believe god isn’t done with america yet



i believe in you i believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of america and that is why today i am announcing that i’m running for president of the united states



it is a time for truth it is a time for liberty it is a time to reclaim the constitution of the united states



i am honored to stand with each and every one of you courageous conservatives as we come together to reclaim the promise of america to reclaim the mandate the hope and opportunity for our children and our children children we stand together for liberty




cruz this is our fight the answer will not come from washington it will come only from the men and women across this country from men and women from people of faith from lovers of liberty from people who respect the constitution

it will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country when the american people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great we will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the united states of america




wow  god bless the great state of iowa  i want to thank each and every one of you for being here  i want to thank citizens united and my good friend steve king for putting this on  you know steve and i spent all week in washington dc  so it is great to be back in america
 
we73re living in remarkable times  just a couple of weeks ago walking down the hall of the capitol i ran into a janitor carrying a screwdriver who was coming to change the sign on harry reid door

and iowa played a big part in that by sending us joni ernst

and i for one sure am glad that we have a farmer as chairman of the judiciary committee

today is the 50th anniversary of winston churchill passing  churchill stood as a lion in winter a voice against the darkness that was sweeping the globe  and i73ll tell you 50 years later we are facing threats every bit as ominous  and today like then we need the clarity of thought and voice and action that churchill provided  one of the very first acts president obama did upon being elected was sending churchill bust back to the uk and i think that foreshadowed everything that was to come the next six years

now i73ll tell you i73m very happy that here with me today is my wife heidi  heidi is an incredible mom she a fantastic businesswoman and she is my very best friend in the entire world  and you know we73re blessed to have two little girls at home  caroline who six catherine who four  and i73ll tell you heidi and i are here for the same reason that all of y73all are here  because we look at what happening in this country and we fear for our children we fear for our grandchildren

so what i want to talk to you about today is reigniting the miracle of america  this country was built on an extraordinary miracle  the miracle of america began with a revolutionary idea which is that our rights they don73t come from government they come from god almighty  and the constitution it serves as jefferson said as chains to bind the mischief of government 

this country was built on incredible opportunity that if you73re a single mom waiting tables you can do anything if you73re a teenage immigrant washing dishes you can do anything  there been no country in the history of the world that has allowed so many millions with nothing to come and seek the unlimited dreams of their potential  

and third the miracle of america has been american exceptionalism that we are the indispensable nation a voice a clarion voice for freedom and we will back down to no face of tyranny

now how do we bring that back  how do we reignite the miracle of america  it is the most important cause that unifies us together and iowa believes in the miracle of america 

number one we champion jobs and economic growth and opportunity  we bring back and environment where small businesses are growing are creating opportunity we get the senseless obstacles from washington out of the way  that means tax reform and regulatory reform  it means sending the locusts of the epa back to washington  i was once out in west texas and i said you know the thing about folks from the epa is unlike locusts you can73t use pesticide against them and an old farmer looked at me and said wanna bet  

and the most important regulatory reform we can do is we need to repeal every word of obamacare  we need tax reform  and the most important tax reform we can do is we need to abolish the irs  we need a simple flat tax that fair that every american can fill out his or her taxes on a post card  there are 110000 employees at the irs  we need to padlock that building and put every one of those 110000 on our southern border  now i say that somewhat tongue in cheek but think about it for a second  imagine you had traveled thousands of miles through central america through the heat  you73re swimming across the rio grande and the first thing you see is 110000 irs agents  you73d turn around and go home too

the second key to reigniting the miracle of america is we need to defend our constitutional rights every single one of them  the first amendment the second amendment the fourth the fifth the tenth amendment  you know no liberty has been more under assault in recent years than religious liberty  whether it is the federal government going after hobby lobby a christian company or going after the little sisters of the poor  and by the way here a real good rule of thumb if you73re litigating against nuns as the obama administration is you73ve probably done something wrong

you know i73m sorry to say one of the most graphic threats to religious liberty occurred in my home town of houston where the city of houston subpoenad five pastors and demanded of those pastors hand over your sermons hand over your sermon notes  

now let me tell you a story that going to lift up your hearts  when that happened that wednesday i decided we were going to try to bring together a group of pastors to have a rally in defense of religious liberty  so heidi and i we73re members of first baptist in houston we called our pastor pastor greg mott  and i said pastor you73ve seen what happened with the subpoenas  he said oh yeah ted i73ve been praying about it all morning  and i said well listen we want to hold a rally we want to bring pastors together we want to do it tomorrow thursday at 11 am  and i wanted to ask you can we do it at the church would you be willing to host it at the church  

and pastor greg begins laughing  and he said you know ted god sometimes moves in ways we cannot understand long before we have any awareness of it  he said a month ago god put it on my heart to begin praying for our city and a month ago he said i reached out to pastors across the city of houston and invited them to come to my office to pray for our city  he said we have 50 pastors from around the city coming to my office tomorrow at 10 am  i73ll tell you it took both our breaths away  and so the next morning i joined those pastors at 10 am we spent an hour on our knees in prayer for the city  we then went down to a rally with over 50 pastors from across racial lines across ethnic lines across denominational lines  heck we even had first baptists and second baptists  and that ain73t easy  

and we stood in that rally together and we said caeser has no jurisdiction over the pulpit  and when you subpoena one pastor you subpoena every pastor  now i73ll tell you believers all over texas all over the country lifted up the situation  conservatives spoke out and the heat and pressure was so great that the city folded under and withdrew the subpoena  we73ve got to defend our constitutional liberties

and third we need to restore america leadership in the world  over the past six years we have seen the fruits of the obama-clinton foreign policy of receding from leadership in the world  leading from behind doesn73t work  just a couple of weeks ago we were horrified at the terrorist attack in the streets of paris and then horrified again when over 40 world leaders came in solidarity and yet missing from that rally graphically was the united states of america

you cannot fight and win a war on radical islamic terrorism if you73re unwilling to utter the words radical islamic terrorism  i would note that the depraved men who flew the planes into the twin towers and the pentagon and to that field in pennsylvania they weren73t a bunch of ticked off presbyterians  i think some of the presbyterians like that  

and you know paris also illustrates that a big ocean doesn73t mean we73re protected from radical islamic terrorism  it one of the reasons i73ve joined with steve king and chuck grassley to introduce the expatriate terrorist act that says that if an american takes up arms with isis he forfeits his or her citizenship

now iowa iowa plays a unique and special role in the political process  the men and women gathered here today and across the state you have a responsibility that you take very seriously to scrutinize any candidate for national office to look them in the eyes and to hold them to account  i73ve got to say a lot of people have the reaction i don73t trust politicians  and that worth applauding because i agree with it  you know in a republican primary every candidate going to come in front of you and say i73m the most conservative guy to ever live  gosh darn it hoo diddly i73m conservative

well you know what talk is cheap  the word tells them you shall know them by their fruit  and one of the most important roles that the men and women in this room the men and women in iowa will play is to look each candidate in the eye and say don73t talk show me

if you say you support liberty show me where you stood up and fought for it  

if you say you support religious liberty show me where you stood up and fought for it

if you say you oppose obamacare show me where you stood up and fought against it

if you say you oppose the president unconstitutional executive amnesty show me where you stood up and fought

if you say you support life and you support marriage show me where you stood up and fought

if you say you73ll stand up to the washington establishment the career politicians of both parties that have gotten us in this mess show me where you73ve stood up and fought

if you say you oppose common core show me where you73ve stood up and fought

and if you say you stand with our friend and ally the nation of israel show me where you73ve stood up and fought

together we need to reassemble the reagan coalition  we need to unify we need to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians and republican women and reagan democrats and young people  we need to bring together a coalition of americans who want to believe again in the miracle of america

now some might say this is hard this is really hard  the media tells us it can73t be done  the media says give up abandon hope go on home  but you know each of us has seen miracles every day  we73ve seen miracles in our own lives in our own families  many of y73all here know my father pastor rafael cruz 

my dad has been my hero my entire life  when he fled cuba as a teenager with nothing after being imprisoned and tortured he was full of hope and opportunity  but let me tell you a different aspect of his story you may not have heard  which is he and my mother moved to canada in the oil and gas business  the canucks in the room they73re giving us some love  

and i73ll tell you when i was born when i was a little boy neither of my parents knew christ  both of them were living fast lives both of them were drinking too much  and when i was three years old my dad decided he didn73t want to be married any more  he didn73t want to be a dad to his three-year old son  so my father got on a plane and he flew back to houston  and back in houston he was working in the oil and gas business when a friend and colleague invited him to a bible study and invited him to clay road baptist church  and he gave his life to jesus  and it transformed his heart and he went to the airport and he bought a plane ticket and he flew back to calgary and he flew back to my mother and he flew back to me  

you know some people ask if faith is real  i can tell you first hand in my family and my life if it were not for the redeeming love if it were not for faith in jesus christ i would have been raised by a single mom without the love of my father in the household

men and women all throughout here have experienced miracles just like that in our lives transforming  the amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me  compared to that the challenges we face in this country are nothing

from the beginning of this country god providential blessing has been on the united states of america  

when we stood up against the mightiest army on the face of the earth and won a revolution as a rag-tag bunch of colonists it was only with god blessing that we did so  

when we survived the horrible civil war that ripped us apart to expunge the original sin of slavery it was only with god blessing that we came back and were stitched together as a nation

when we stood with winston churchill to defeat the nazis and the scourge of evil it was only with god blessing that we saved freedom on this planet  

and when president reagan stood before the brandenberg gate and said mr gorbachev tear down this wall it was only with god grace and blessing that we won the cold war 

we have done it before over and over again and we can do it again  we can come together   and the answer the reason i am hopeful the reason i am optimistic is because of each and every one of you  the answer is the grassroots is the american people  we are working to build a grassroots army all across this country  the answer will not come from washington it will only come from the american people  so i would ask every one of you that has your cell phone i would ask you on your cell phone to text the word constitution to the number 33733  i73m going to give you that again  the word constitution to the number 33733  what we73re working to do is to bring together that same coalition of men and women across iowa across this country to say we do not accept losing this country  we will together reignite the miracle of america we will together bring back that shining city on a hill that is the united states of america  thank you and god bless you



of course look it shouldn73t be complicated that members of the campaign staff should not be physically assaulting the press i mean that shouldn73t be a complicated decision

i73ll tell you the way you do that - it the situation if two guys are hiking in the woods and a bear start chasing and you know the old joke that the fellow sits down and starts to put on his running shoes and the guy turns to his friend and says what are you doing you can73t outrun the bear

he has just been charged i know that the reporter alleged that she was physically assaulted that i will say it consistent with the pattern of the trump campaign


the culture of the campaign has been a campaign built on attacks on insults and i think there is no place in politics for insults for personal attacks for going to the gutter and there should be no place for physical violence either

 absolutely and our path going forward is to get 1237 most of the races coming up are either winner-take-all or winner-take-most
 and the guy says i don73t have to outrun the bear i just have to outrun you

that principal is the same thing going forward if we continue to beat donald trump - you know we just had a few days ago in utah a massive victory against donald trump and we got all of the delegates in utah if we continue to beat donald trump going forward most of the states are winner-take-all or winner-take-most and we get north of 80 percent of the delegates simply by beating donald trump going forward



look but you don73t have to win 85 percent anderson  the way it works you have to win the races going forward but when you win you get most or all the delegates

and here the dynamic that has played out  a year ago there were 17 candidates  it was a fantastic diverse dynamic field  the field has narrowed now  and what donald benefits from is division because donald has had pretty consistently a floor of about 20 to 25 percent

but he has got a hard ceiling of about 35 to 40 percent that he has a real hard time breaking  and so when there are two or three or four other candidates and they divide the vote he can win state after state with 30 35 percent even 40 percent

head to head donald has an incredibly difficult time breaking 50 percent


well it makes no sense at all  john kasich has no path to win it  we are competing to win  we73re not competing to stop trump  we73re competing to win the nomination  john kasich went 0 for 27  he lost 27 states in a row


look i understand except that it against the rules for john kasich to be on the ballot  the rules provide that in order to be even on the ballot if no one has 1237 you have to have won at least 8 states

now there are only two candidates who are going to meet that threshold donald trump and me  and so our preferred option is win 1237 delegates before the convention  we are working hard to do that  and i73ll mention wisconsin is going to be critical in that

but the second option which is entirely possible we could get to a convention where nobody has 1237 delegates and we come in with a ton of delegates donald trump comes in with a ton of delegates

and if that happens then it becomes a battle for the delegates but the only two names on the ballot are going to be donald trump and me  on the rules those are the only two people that can be voted on

and i think in that situation we73re in a very strong position to earn the 1237 votes from the delegates who are elected by the people

 look what i believe we should do is we need a commander-in-chief who is actually focused on keeping this country safe  you know we saw…
 
   let me answer your question  we had a terror attack in brussels last week  it was a horrific attack  president obama could barely be bothered to stop his baseball game with communist dictators to say anything about it
 and when he did he followed this bizarre pattern that he has followed for year after year after year where he refuses to say the words radical islamic terrorism

instead what he does what he did after the paris terror attack what he did after san bernardino is he goes on television and he lectures americans about islamophobia

enough is enough  how about a president that actually stands up and defends this country  we need a commander-in-chief…
what it means is that we target the enemy  now there is a difference between islam and islamism  islamism is a political and theocratic philosophy that commands its adherents to wage violent jihad to murder or to forcibly convert all infidels

and by infidels they mean every one of the rest of us  islamism is our enemy  and when president obama and hillary clinton and the modern democratic party play this politically correct game of denying it it means they don73t fight it effectively

so for example let talk about the consequences of it  obama and hillary both advocate bringing tens of thousands of syrian muslim refugees to america
new york police have pushed back on that  chief bratton said that just complete bunk  and i want to read you what in fact - i mean the guy who ran that program that you say was such a big success says it didn73t lead to any prosecutions there were no leads from it
listen you are right that after i called for increased vigilance protecting us that barack obama hillary clinton and new york mayor bill de blasio all attacked me i wear that as a badge of pride i will not apologize to anyone

i understand that the commissioner who works for bill de blasio has a political imperative de blasio is a left-wing radical
it was set up under mayor michael bloomberg to monitor and to work cooperatively with the muslim community to prevent radicalization and to stop radical islamic terrorism plots before it occurs
there are a number of cases it identified a bookstore that was a locus for radicalization and allowed law enforcement to after that bookstore and what happened was when mayor bill de blasio got elected he gave in to political correctness and shut the unit down

listen if you want to stop radical islamic terrorism the answer isn73t to go hang out in random neighborhoods it is instead to focus on communities where radicalization is a risk and i73ll tell you what europe has done

europe has followed the path that barack obama and hillary clinton want to put us on that the tragedies these terror attacks in europe are a result of failed immigration policies where they73ve allowed vast numbers of islamic terrorists to come into europe and they73re in communities that are isolated they73re called no-go communities where the law enforcement doesn73t engage in those communities

one in brussels molenbeek has been a particular incubator for radical islamic terrorism many of these terrorist plots trace back to molenbeek

my plan is very simple america should not make the mistakes of europe we should not disengage we should have law enforcement actively engage to stop radicalization before it stops - and i recognize that the media and the democrats hate it when someone actually describes who the enemy is

i73ll tell ya73 as president every single day i will wake up fighting radical islamic terrorism and working to defeat it
sure there the story on its face quoted on the record roger stone
roger stone has been donald trump chief political adviser he planned and ran his presidential campaign and he been his hatchet man he spent 40 years as a hatchet man but not only that the head of the national enquirer a guy named david pecker is good friends with donald trump
 of course i do when his good friend - you know the national enquirer in its history has never endorsed a presidential candidate until donald trump

and now david pecker - look donald trump suggested david pecker the head of the national enquirer should take over time magazine who in their right mind should suggest the head of the national enquirer should take over time magazine
look what i knew was that the media was engaged in a love fest giving donald trump $2 billion dollars in premium ph
let be clear how many hours of free media do cnn and fox and every other station - you let him call in and for a year - $2 billion dollars of free media
i want to point out i73ve been inviting donald trump for several days to come and make this a debate he coming later and he terrified to make it a debate because he doesn73t want to actually stand and have his record challenged

 let me make a point there has been a distinction that i have followed throughout which is that i keep the focus on issues and substance so i73m happy to draw distinction with donald trump on the issues whether it is economic policy - that he doesn73t have a policy to bring jobs back to america whether it is national security where is advocating for a far too weak foreign policy that leaves us vulnerable

what i73m not interested in doing is what donald pattern has been which is the personal attacks it going to the gutter it attacking family members

none of that has any place in politics we ought to be discussing tax policy we ought to be discussing national security we ought to be discussing substance
listen with me as with many people in america my faith is an integral part of who i am  i73m a christian and i73m not embarrassed to say that  i73m not going to hide that and treat it like it something you can73t admit publicly and acknowledge  it an important part of who you are

but i also think those in politics have an obligation not to wear their faith on their sleeve  there have been far too many politicians that run around behaving like they73re holier than thou

and i73ll tell you my attitude as a voter when some politician stands up and says i73m running because god told me to vote - to run my reaction as a voter is great when god tells me to vote for you we73ll be on the same page
and so listen i73m not asking you to vote for me because of my personal faith with jesus christ  i73m asking you to vote for me because i73ve spent a lifetime fighting to defend the constitution and the bill of rights fighting to defend the american free enterprise system and we need a leader who will stand up every day and protect the rights of everyone whether they73re christians  or jews or muslims or anyone else  the bill of rights protects all americans  it protects atheists  that the beauty of the bill of rights is that we have the freedom to seek out god to worship and to live according to our faith and our conscience and i think the constitution and bill of rights is a unifying principle that can bring us together across faiths across races across ethnicity  and we need to come together behind the unifying principles that built america
well tim thank you for that question  and thank you for your son jordan serving and thank you for his sacrifice

you know the question of when to commit us armed forces to combat is the most serious decision any president can make  and i believe the decision to use military force should be keyed to the vital national security interest of this country  far too often we73ve seen in the last seven years where president obama has not focused on our national security interests

so for example we saw in libya moammar gadhafi the dictator there was a bad man  he had a horrible human rights record  he had been a state sponsor of terrorists  but gadhafi in his latter years had actually shaped up his conduct pretty dramatically in response to us strength and had become an active participant working with america stopping radical islamic terrorists - tracking them down apprehending them handing them over to us  and what president obama and hillary clinton did is they ended up joining with and leading many world forces in toppling gadhafi ultimately killing gadhafi  and the consequence in libya is that country was handed over to radical islamic terrorists  it become a war zone of battling war lords  and
 i understand  and i73m answering the question anderson  thank you

that was an enormous mistake  and the reason they made the mistake is they weren73t focused on us national security interests  they were in the interests of promoting democracy and toppling a government that ends up handing it over to radical islamic terrorists is a much worse outcome

we saw a similar thing in egypt where obama and hillary both cheered the toppling of hosni mubarak the head of egypt  egypt was handed over to the muslim brotherhood mohamed morsi  the muslim brotherhood is a terrorist organization that was profoundly harmful for us national security interests  thankfully president el-sisi is now in charge of egypt

now with regard to syria assad is a monster  i agree with you  he a horrible man  he has murdered hundreds of thousands of his own citizens  he has murdered women  he has murdered children  he has used chemical weapons against them

but the problem is if we simply topple assad the most likely outcome is that isis takes over syria  and handing syria over to isis to radical islamic terrorists who are waging war with us is a mistake

so your question of what we should do our focus i believe in syria should not be on toppling assad  our focus should be on utterly and completely destroying isis because isis is our enemy and isis has declared war on america and they pose a direct threat to our national security interests
 look i will do whatever is necessary militarily to defeat isis  now defeating isis is going to have a lot of components  one of the most important components is overwhelming air power 
nobody has talked about targeting civilian areas  what i have suggested we should do is use overwhelming air power  and let me - let talk some specifics and some facts

 let talk specific facts  the first persian gulf war a little over 25 years ago we were launching roughly 1100 air attacks a day  we were using overwhelming airpower  it one of the great strengths of the tremendous american military is our air superiority is second to none
 compare the - but hold on let me make my point please sir  if you compare those two numbers 1100 air attacks a day we did that for 37 days and then our troops went in and in a day-and-a-half mopped up what was left of the iraqi army

eleven hundred air attacks a day does crushing debilitating damage  fifteen to 30 a day is photo-op foreign policy
but you can use all of those tools  so you can take out their command and control headquarters  you can take out their communication  you can take out their means of transportation ingress and egress

you can take out their oil fields  you can take out their oil refining capacity  you can take out their infrastructure  you can target their troops and their troop movements

and we73re not doing that right now  overwhelming airpower is the first step now it not the only step but overwhelming airpower is the first step  the next step is arming the kurds  the kurds the peshmerga fighting forces of the kurds are very very effective fighters

they73re longtime allies of america  they73re fighting isis right now  isis is using us military equipment that they seized in iraq  the kurds are using outmoded equipment and the obama administration refuses to arm them because of political reasons  that doesn73t make sense

we ought to be arming the kurds and let them kill isis  and then beyond that the question of special forces and ground troops  we should do whatever is necessary to win but i73ll tell you what i won73t do is i will not send our troops into combat the way barack obama is doing with rules of engagement so strict that they cannot fight they cannot win and they cannot defeat the enemy

if we73re going to use our troops we73re going to defeat the enemy

i73m just such a disciplined employee i just put my work in front of everything else

look there are pros and cons to it  what i will say is i73m a pretty driven guy  that has pros and cons  i have always been a very driven guy

cruz   i73m just such a disciplined employee i just put my work in front of everything else

look there are pros and cons to it  what i will say is i73m a pretty driven guy  that has pros and cons  i have always been a very driven guy  i believe passionately in free-market principles and the constitution  my whole life - i mean when i was a teenager i studied and memorized a shortened mnemonic ph version of the constitution and traveled around as part of a non-profit organization in houston speaking about the constitution speaking about free-market principles

and you know a lot of that i think the reason that i73m so driven on this front has to do with my family background  my father was imprisoned and tortured in cuba and when my dad came to america he had nothing and it really is - it an amazing thing when you grow up in the house with someone who fled oppression because i remember when i was a little kid we73d be watching tv and there was an urgency to politics  it wasn73t oh that interesting a couple of candidates  it was having principled men and women in office is how you protect yourself from tyranny

now i73ll confess growing up in a cuban-american household you73re raised where there are two families - there are two parties  the republicans and the communists
and anyone who is cuban-american will understand i73m not kidding really with that

now i was really saddened to see barack obama go and pal around with the castros and pose under a che guevera picture  i mean it drove that point home

but as a kid that gives you an urgency  and so at times listen i73m hard charging  that means i73ve stepped on some toes  that means i73ve been focused very hard on fighting those fights and maybe i should have pulled back in some circumstances  so it is a strength and a weakness

but i will say this i am someone who what you see is what you get  you know what i73m going to do in office  it what i73ve done every day  it what i believe  it what i73ve spent my life fighting for  and i think we73re at a time where we need a president who we know what he will do and we know we can trust them to follow through on what they73re saying

 and i worry about that question what lesson to our kids take watching this

you know heidi and i our girls are 5 and 7  and they73re watching presidential candidates insulting each other yelling cursing attacking family members  i mean it gotten really ugly and just when you don73t think it can get any uglier it gets uglier  i think that has no place in politics and my view - i have no ability to control what another candidate does

but what i can control is my approach  i73ll tell you the promise that i made to the people who joined our campaign from the beginning the supporters who were with us from the beginning  i said listen i can73t promise we73re going to win i think we will but i can promise you two things  one we73re going to work every day with a joyful spirit we73re going to work every day and put everything weave into this campaign and number two we73re going to do so with integrity  we73re not going to go into the gutter  we73re not going to attack people personally  we73re not going to malign their character  we73re going to focus on issues and substance

now in the course of the campaign there have been a bunch of candidates engaging in personal insults  i73ve worked very very hard to stay out of that and say i73m not going into the gutter  if you attack me personally i73m not going to respond in kind

now if you want to talk about your tax plan i73ll compare my tax plan to your tax plan  that should be the bread and butter of politics  and it is my hope that at the end of the day that that is the approach that prevails  i think it what the people of wisconsin want  i think it what the people of america want

right  well thank you for sharing your experience as a dairy farmer and you know there are farmers across this country who are really hurting  and farmers are hurting from a lot of things

they73re hurting from a federal government whose policies have been making it harder and harder for farmers to survive  they73re hurting from an epa who is imposing massive burdens on farms

for example the waters of the united states rule where the epa has tried to define a puddle or a drainage ditch on your farm to be navigable waters and thus subject to massive environmental regulations

and i think we need a president we need an administration that takes the burdens off farmers so that it is easier to do your job which is incredibly important

now when it comes to labor i understand the need to have labor and that it can be hard to have agricultural labor  you know i73ll tell you though one of the consequences of our immigration system right now when we73ve got 12 million people who are here illegally that has an effect of driving down wages for americans across this country

there was a very interesting article it was about oh a month maybe six weeks ago in the wall street journal it was focusing on arizona  you73ll recall several years ago arizona put in place really tough laws on illegal immigration

and they were criticized loudly for putting those laws in place  and it was interesting this wall street journal article because it talked about what happened in the wake of that law which is a great many of the illegal immigrants left

they left the state and went elsewhere  and it actually quoted a farmer and that the reason i73m bringing up this example it quoted a farmer a fellow in arizona who was growing peppers

and he complained he said listen all people that we had picking peppers they left  and he said i didn73t know what to do  i didn73t  know that we were going to be able to pick our peppers


and what it described that he did is he actually went and invented a new tool to help pick the peppers  and then he went down to the local community college and he ended up hiring americans coming out of the community college

he had to pay them more  he paid them about $15 an hour  but he continues picking his peppers except he doing so in a situation where what has happened in arizona the public expenditures have plummeted

arizona is spending hundreds of millions of dollars less on prisons on education on hospitals for those here illegally  that means that hundreds of millions of dollars available to take care of us citizens

and also unemployment has gone down and median wages for americans have gone up in the construction industry carpenters  we73re seeing wages going up

and i think the view - our immigration laws should benefit american workers  that should be the focus of immigration laws
and so what i intend to do as president is number one we73re going to secure the border  we73re going to end illegal immigration  we know how to do it  and what missing is the political will to get it done  the difference is i will get it done

but beyond that when it comes to legal immigration listen i think on immigration the principles are really simple  legal good  illegal bad  it amazing how many - how many folks in politics how many folks in the media have trouble understanding that

i73m reminded you guys remember former congressman sonny bono from sonny  cher  years ago sonny bono was asked what your view on illegal immigration  he said well it illegal isn73t it

we73re going to solve this problem by securing the border and ending illegal immigration  and once we do that that going to drive up wages for americans across this country

and in the agriculture world i think the first option should be trying to find american workers  now that may mean wages come up  it may mean that we have to use more tools  we73ve seen in arizona that has happened

and beyond that our legal immigration system if there are needs in the labor force and american workers not available to do it that where legal immigration should come in

but it should be in a situation where you73re vetting the people rather than just having people come in that we don73t know who they are and we don73t know their criminal history we don73t know their background

it should be through the legal system targeted in a way that protects american workers
well anderson as you mentioned what i said is true  i73m not in the habit of supporting someone who attacks my wife and attacks my family i think that is going beyond the line i think our wives i think our kids should be off limits  they don73t belong in the attacks

nd listen i73m not an easy person to tick off but when you go after my wife when you go after my daughters that does it  and i think - i want this race to stay focused on policy and issues and solutions to the real problems facing america  that where i73m going to stay focused  but if other candidates don73t i think that beyond the pale


listen i think nominating donald trump would be an absolute train wreck  i think it would hand the general election to hillary clinton  poll after poll after poll shows donald trump losing 10 11 12 points or more  i don73t want to see the white house given over to hillary clinton  i don73t want to see us lose the senate and house lose the supreme court for a generation lose the bill of rights  i think nominating donald trump is a disaster and so the answer to that is not to scream and yell and cry and attack him the answer to that is to beat him at the ballot box  that what we73re working every day to do  it what we73re campaigning every day here in wisconsin to do
 
you know there are some in politics who say it an eitheror choice  we can either protect america or protect our civil liberties  i don73t accept that choice  i think it is possible to walk and chew gum at the same time  i think it is possible - and the difference - something the obama administration is not very good at - they73re not very good at distinguishing between bad guys and good guys  so over and over again the obama administration solution for example when it comes to surveillance was to monitor the phone calls or the e-mails of millions of law-abiding citizens but because of their political correctness because they won73t focus on and identify radical islamic terrorists they don73t actually target the bad guys  it why it so important - and you know it interesting benjamin people in the media sometimes they ask why does it matter whether obama will say the words radical islamic terrorism  it matters because if you don73t identify the problem you don73t devote - you don73t direct law enforcement and national security resources to stopping it

i73ll give a specific example  my home state of florida fort hood nidal hassan committed a horrific terrorist attack there  now the  obama administration knew before the attack that nidal hassan communicated with anwar al awlaki a known radical islamic cleric  they knew that nidal hassan had asked about the permissibility of waging jihad and murdering his fellow soldiers  and yet for whatever reason political correctness or what have you they didn73t do anything  if we find out that a member of the armed services is talking with a radical islamic cleric and asking about waging jihad against his fellow soldiers within minutes mps should show up at his door and put him in handcuffs
  but they didn73t do that and nidal hassan murdered 14 innocent souls including an unborn child yelling allahu akbar  and then the obama administration in truly a stunning display of political correctness defined that terrorist attack as workplace violence  we need to direct our resources at going after the nidal hassans going after the radical islamic terrorists and we can do that at the same time as not infringing the privacy of law-abiding americans distinguishing between the bad guys and the good guys  that what this administration hadn73t been doing
  
  well victoria thank you for that question and you73re absolutely right

you know i will say one of the things i73ve really been blessed in my life is that i have a grown up surrounded by strong women my mom is someone who i admire immensely my mom is irish-italian she grew up wilmington delaware she grew up in a working-class family

her mom was the second youngest of 17 kids and my mom became the first person in her family ever to go to college and that was not easy for her because my grandfather her dad he was not an easy man he was a drunk and he didn73t think women should be educated

and so my mom stood up to her father she stood up to him confronted him and she ended up going rice she majored in math in 1956 and then she got hired at shell as a computer programmer

now you want to talk about two industries computer science and oil and gas neither one of which were welcoming to women and my mom was at the intersection of them both

and i remember my mom used to tell me a lot when i was a kid she said she very deliberately didn73t learn how to type she said look it was the 1950s i understood the world i was living

she didn73t want to be walking down the hall and have some man stop her and say sweetheart would you type this for me

she wanted to be able to respond with a clean conscience and smile and say i would love to help you out but i don73t know how to type


  i guess you73re going to have to use me as a computer programmer instead

and whether it my mom who as a pioneer computer programmer - she 81 now she been a best friend to me my whole life she an amazing grandmother to our two little girls whether it my wife heidi who is the daughter of christian missionaries she lived in africa as a kid several times she someone who has been an incredible businesswoman she strong

listen when you73re married to a strong woman professional you see the nonsense that women deal with in the business environment you see the garbage they put up with and it makes you mad i73ve been blessed my whole life to be surrounded by strong women

i think women right now are particularly concerned about the direction of this country are particularly concerned our kids are going to have what kind of country we73re giving to the next generation

i think women quite rightly are very concerned about safety and security and a president that protecting us from terrorists

and i believe what protects women - you know the democrats love to put everyone in a little pigeon hole and so this is a woman issue this is a hispanic issue this is an african-american issue listen i believe every issue is a woman issue and the focus of my campaign is on three things it on jobs freedom and security

bringing back the opportunity raising wages bringing jobs back to america i think that is resonating powerfully with women and fighting to protect the bill of rights and equal opportunity for women and men and everyone and i73ll tell you there no one i fight harder for than our two little girls caroline and catherine who are the loves of my life and who can do anything and i want to make sure they have a world they can live in where they have the opportunity to do anything


and this is a tragedy we73re seeing across the country  we73re seeing veterans coming back struggling with ptsd struggling to get their health care needs treated treated properly  we73re seeing a va that is dysfunctional  a va that is lying

one of the things we need is we need real accountability in the va i give you my word if i am president there will be accountability in the va those that have lied those that have wrongfully denied care they will be terminated  and if they broke the law they will be prosecuted

we also need reform in the va so that veterans have the power to choose their own doctors  whether they want to choose the va or a private doctor there no reason your son jason couldn73t have gone to the doctor down the street
 now i agree with you we need greater scrutiny greater involvement preventing opioid abuse  you look at the prevalence of heroin - and i would note this is a tragedy roughly 50000 people a year die of drug overdoses  more people in america die of drug overdoses than die in car crashes

and marv i73m sorry to say you and i are both members of a horrible club because i lost my sister miriam to a drug overdose and so i73ve seen first hand - and it actually started - it started when she was in a car accident and she got prescribed painkillers  and she kept on taking the painkillers and then she started taking strong and she started taking stronger  and miriam led a difficult and troubled life  she made a lot of very poor decisions and then just a few years ago she took too many pills one night and her son came in and found her dead

this is an epidemic that is destroying families across america  i73 am sorry for your family loss  i73m sorry my nephew joey her son someone i73m really proud of  he endured his mom difficult journey and he working a good job he a responsible - he a terrific young man

but we need a federal government that focuses on stopping this drug abuse whether it is prescription drug abuse or whether it is illegal narcotics like heroin and one of the most important ways to stop that - you know unfortunately my sister miriam ended up going down that path going down the path of crack cocaine and drugs that destroyed her life

one of the ways to prevent that is we need to secure the border  we need to get serious about stopping the incredible flow from mexican drug cartels that are poisoning our kids  and you have my commitment as president - i73m not going to talk about it i73m not going to make empty promises but we are going to devote the full resources of the federal government to finally finally finally  secures the border stopping illegal immigration but stopping the deluge of drugs that is coming into this country and destroying the lives of people all across this country


listen it is a huge problem we see of a need for a trained workforce and a need for a workforce that prepared and wants to work  you know as i meet with small business owners all across the country i hear those concerns over and over and over again that it hard to get people who are qualified and who want to work and are prepared to work and that a real challenge  and you know the key to jobs and job creation is small businesses is doing what you do  how many employees do you guys have

about 300  i mean that where job creation comes from  it comes from small businesses two-thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses

now in terms of getting new and able workers we need to do several things  number one we need to reform education  you know the step to having well-trained workers is having a strong education program

and if you look at education right now number one i think the federal government needs to get the heck out of it

and i think what we ought to be doing is abolishing the federal department of education and block-granting that money to send it back to wisconsin  i think the people of wisconsin know much better what to do with that money

and part of that money i think should be directed at school choice programs and allowing people who are trapped in failing schools to have the option of going to private schools going to parochial schools injecting competition in failing schools to empower parents and empower students

i think school choice is the civil rights issue of the 21st century
and part of that money as well in wisconsin ought to be directed to vocational training ought to be directed to different nontraditional ways where people can earn skills whether it distance learning whether it is using the internet using options where your only option isn73t spending $50000 a year at a four-year college but expanding the options for people to get education

i think that is a critical piece to improving the environment  and another critical piece is changing our welfare program  you know our welfare program right now traps people in dependency

now my view on welfare is that the social safety net it should be a trampoline and not a hammock  that the whole purpose of the social safety net should be to get you back on your feet

everyone falls on hard times but you73re not helping someone trapping them in dependence  and i73ll tell you i visited with a fellow who owns a cookie factory  tell you between cookies and cheese you really can have a great party right there



but he owns a cookie factory  and he talked to me about where in the 1990s when congress passed welfare reform when congress put in place a strong work requirement for welfare and you recall the liberals in the media were saying you73re going to throw people out on the street people are going to be starving it going to be terrible

it one of the most successful public policy reforms we73ve ever seen  millions of people left welfare and got jobs  this fellow who owns the cookie factory described to me how suddenly they had people lining up to work

because they weren73t getting paid in perpetuity to stay at home and watch gilligan island they had to go get a job  and you know what if you help someone get a job ultimately that is giving them the dignity of work  i believe every american wants to have that dignity to provide for their families


wow  what a privilege to be with you  you know i spent much of last month in washington dc so it is great to be back in america  i spent this morning at the iowa state fair  that is fantastic  i go to try something i73ve never had before a pork chop on a stick  you know it really hard to go wrong with meat on a stick  and i73ll tell you it brought to mind a new diet that is all the rage in washington  it the obama diet  it works very very well  all you do is every day you let putin eat your lunch

it is such a blessing to be back with so many conservative leaders and activists men and women of faith throughout the state of iowa men and women standing up for your state and for our great country  i am here today with a message of hope and optimism  you know if you listen to the media if you listen to the democrats—although i repeat myself—they will tell you conservatives cannot win they will tell you that america has become a liberal-progressive utopia that embraces the failed big government solutions from washington  let me tell you this  they don73t know the people of the united states of america

so i want to talk to you about how we win  and there a very simple model for how we win  we stand up and we tell the truth  we shine the light of truth and we empower the american people  so i73m going to talk to you today about seven victories seven major victories for conservatives that the men and women in this room have won in the last two years


let start with number one  last spring the battle over guns  we all remember right after the tragic shooting in newtown ct when president obama came out he didn73t come out and say let go after violent criminals which he should have done  instead he tried to use it as an excuse to go after the second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens  and everyone in washington said it is hopeless this can73t be stopped  all of the political momentum is with the president to exploit this tragedy to take away our liberties  

well i73ll tell you i was proud to stand with my friends mike lee and rand paul in saying we will filibuster any legislation that undermines the second amendment right to keep and bear arms  now what that did is it shined a light on the battle and it gave time for the grassroots to engage it gave time for each of you to light up the phones to confront your senators on the senate floor in their town halls and say why aren73t you standing and fighting for the second amendment   indeed the lead legislative alternative to president obama gun control efforts was the grassley-cruz legislation that i co-wrote with your senator here my friend chuck grassley  

and i will confess my philosophy is very simple  in texas we define gun control as hittin73 what you73re aiming at  but the american people rose up and spoke with a clarion voice and when president obama gun control proposals came to a vote on the senate floor every single proposal that would have undermined the second amendment was voted down on the senate floor  that was y73all victory that was won by the conservative grassroots across this country 


victory number two  [long pause]  victory number two occurred in the supreme court just a few weeks ago  victory number two was the hobby lobby victory  hobby lobby as you know is a christian company that had the courage to stand up against obamacare and say we will fight for our religious liberty that the federal government cannot use obamacare to force us to pay for abortion inducing drugs  

now i was very pleased to author a us supreme court brief on behalf of several senators in the hobby lobby case and to go our front on the day of the argument with grassroots conservative supporters from all over the country standing for religious liberty  and the supreme court in a fantastic decision struck down that provision of obamacare and said the federal government cannot trample our religious liberty rights in this country  now i73m sorry to say the democrats responded to that in the senate with some of the most extreme legislation we73ve ever seen  the democrats introduced legislation to repeal major portions of the religious freedom restoration act which protects the religious liberties of every american  when bill clinton signed that law into law it was approved in the senate 97 to 3  unfortunately every single senate democrat stood together voting to take away our religious liberty  

if you want to understand what the hobby lobby fight was about if you want to understand what the vote of the senate  democrats to take away our religious liberty was about you need look no further than the little sisters of the poor  now who are the little sisters of the poor  they are a catholic convent of nuns who have taken vows of poverty and devote their lives to providing health care to the poor and the elderly  right now today the obama administration is litigating against the little sisters of the poor and they are trying to impose millions of dollars of fines on the little sisters of the poor in order to force them to pay for abortion-inducing drugs  now let me give you a very simple rule of thumb  if you73re litigating against nuns you73ve probably done something wrong  and it is stunning that every senate democrat voted to impose faith fines on the christian owners of hobby lobby on the little sisters of the poor on any american who wants to stand up and follow the dictates of our faith and conscience  

there was a time when religious liberty brought us together in a bipartisan manner  we need to get back to that time  but hobby lobby was a second major victory


a third major victory occurred several months ago when the nation of iran named hamid abutalebi to be their ambassador to the united nations  now abutalebi you73ll remember is a known terrorist who participated in holding americans hostage in 1979 and 1980  iran naming abutalebi was meant to be and was in fact a slap in the face to the united states  now a lot of folks in washington said this is terrible but there is nothing you can do about it  

well i73m happy to tell you i introduced legislation in the united states senate to bar abutalebi from being allowed to enter this country  that legislation received support on the senate floor from senators as varied as lindsey graham and chuck schumer  in fact i came up to chuck afterwards i said chuck you better be careful lightening going to strike you  and i73m happy to tell you that legislation passed the united states senate 100 to zero  it then passed the house of representatives 435 to zero  and then wonder of wonders president obama signed it into law  

actually two weeks later at the white house correspondents73 dinner president obama joked about it  he said you know a couple of week s ago ted cruz introduced legislation that i signed into law  he said here a picture of the signing ceremony  it had a picture of him a picture of me and the devil and hell freezing over  but that was another major victory where we changed our law to prohibit known terrorists from living in manhattan with diplomatic immunity


let me give you a fourth example a wonderful wonderful example the example of miriam ibrahim  so many men and women in this room know the plight of miriam ibrahim  so many of us have been lifting her up in our prayers  miriam is a young mom a young wife who has two little children—martin who 20 months old and little baby maya who a newborn  she was born in a sudanese prison she was born with her mother with her legs in leg irons  now what was miriam crime under sudanese law  her crime was being a christian  and for that crime she was sentenced to receive 100 lashes and then to hang by the neck until dead  and the sudanese government went to miriam and said if only you will renounce christ we will spare you this horrible sentence  and miriam said i cannot and i will not renounce jesus  

how many of us have ever had our faith tested like that  but i can tell you millions of believers here in iowa all across the country all across the world lifted miriam up in our prayers  many of us spoke out loudly against the atrocity of torturing and murdering miriam ibrahim simply for being a christian  i73m sorry to say one of the people who didn73t stand up was president obama  president obama somehow couldn73t bring himself to stand up and say to the government of sudan free miriam ibrahim now  but praise god the international pressure became too much  the government of sudan freed miriam and she is now back home in the state of new hampshire with her babies  that example number three victory number three


victory number four—five  i could say oops but that would make news  victory number five  all of us our hearts are breaking at what happening in israel  as rockets rain down on the nation of israel as we discovered a network of terror tunnels coming in dug by hamas terrorists and comping up in kindergartens for terrorists to kidnap and murder young children  

well in the midst of this we all remember just a few weeks ago when the faa issued an unprecedented ban on airlines flying into the nation of israel  entire history of the faa they have never banned flights into israel  and our office put out a lengthy statement raising some important questions  we asked did president obama just launch an economic boycott on the nation of israel  we pointed out that the faa doesn73t ban flights into pakistan into yemen into afghanistan  indeed the faa doesn73t even ban flights into much of ukraine despite the fact that a commercial airliner was just shot down at 30000 feet with a russian buk missile  

so we asked the question why is israel targeted for differential treatment for economic punishment and why was this announced at the exact same time that john kerry arrives in the middle east with $57 million to give to gaza that will end up in the hands of hamas and at the same time that the obama administration is pressuring the government of israel to stop working to dismantle the terror tunnels and the rockets that are raining death on the citizens of israel  let me tell you that within an hour of raising that question the spokesman for the state department was being asked is this an economic boycott designed to pressure the nation of israel  

and the outcry the outcry from the grassroots the outcry from americans and the fact that we weren73t standing with the nation of israel was deafening and within 36 hours the faa lifted the ban and resumed flights into the nation of israel  those are five victories five victories that are completed


the final two victories are victories that are not yet complete but as we say in texas they73re fixin73 to be completed  victory number six is on immigration  in my home state of texas we are seeing a humanitarian crisis play out on the border  just a few weeks ago i was down on the border meeting with the border patrol  we have seen the number of unaccompanied children skyrocket  the president is right that it a humanitarian crisis but it is a crisis of his own making  it is the direct consequence of president obama lawlessness  

here are the basic numbers  three years ago in 2011 there were roughly 6000 unaccompanied children apprehended trying to cross into this country  then in 2012 the president unilaterally granted amnesty to some 800000 people who entered illegally as kids  now the direct and foreseeable consequence the predicted consequence—if you grant amnesty to people who entered as kids—it creates an enormous incentive for millions more or thousands more or tens of thousands more kids to come into this country  and we73ve seen the number skyrocket  three years ago it was 6000 this year it expected to be 90000 children crossing illegally into this country  next year it predicted to be 145000  

and listen these are little boys and little girls that are being trafficked in not by well-meaning social workers with beards and birkenstocks but by hardened violent transnational drug cartels and coyotes who are physically assaulting who are sexually assaulting these little boys and girls  it is not humane to continue this system of lawlessness that results predictably in tens of thousands of children being victimized  

so i introduced legislation in the us senate to end president obama amnesty prospectively to end the promise of amnesty to solve the problem  and also to provide federal reimbursements to the states that have called up border patrol to secure the border and do the job that the federal government should have been doing including i73m proud to say my home state governor rick perry  now when i introduced that legislation democrats demagogued it they vilified it they said no we don73t want to fix the problem  

but i73m happy to tell you the house of representative stood up and led  just over a week ago the house of representatives passed two major bills that mirrored the legislation that i had introduced to end president obama amnesty and to solve the humanitarian crisis at the border  what did harry reid do  he refused to allow a vote on any meaningful reform and he sent the senate home for august without doing anything to fix the problem  republicans in the house are leading and senate democrats are obstructing and doing nothing  now we haven73t solved this problem yet as long as harry reid is majority leader but let me tell you something right now come january 2015 harry reid not going to be majority leader any longer  


and the final victory that we haven73t yet won but we73ve laid the groundwork to winning is repealing every single word of obamacare  the fight we had last summer and fall where millions of americans stood up and said stop this train wreck this disaster that is obamacare that killing millions of jobs that forcing millions into part-time work that taken away the health care of millions of americans that fight elevated the stakes of the debate and as a direct consequence suddenly republicans instead of being competitive in five or six or senate seats are competitive in 10 12 14 senate seats all over the country as obamacare is an albatross around the necks of the democrats who foisted it on the american people  and i73ll tell you what as a direct result of the damage obamacare is causing republicans are going to retake the senate and we73re going to welcome a new colleague in the senate senator joni ernst from the state of iowa  and we73re going to introduce some senate democrats to the private sector where they won73t be exempt from obamacare any more 

and as a result of your efforts making the case telling the truth shining the light empowering the american people i am convinced come 2017 with a new president in the white house we will repeal every word of obamacare


let me say finally the lesson from these seven victories is there is a path to winning  it is not being mamby pamby  it is not standing for nothing and giving into the ways of washington  it is as reagan said painting in bold colors and not pale pastels  we need to stand unambiguously for the common sense conservative principles shared by the vast majority of americans  

we need to stand for life  we need to stand for marriage  we need to abolish the irs  we need to repeal obamacare  we need to repeal common core  and we need to bring back jobs growth and opportunity and defend the constitution  

that is a positive hopeful optimistic vision for america that brings us together that turns us around that brings us to a better path  that is the victory that the men and women in this room are leading the fight it is because of you i am optimistic it is because of you that together we are going to pull back from the precipice  together we are going to get back to the founding principles of this country  together we are going to restore that shining city on a hill that is the united states of america  thank you and god bless you


good morning  god bless cpac
now i do have to start with a bit of bad news this morning  i73m sorry to tell you that by virtue of your being here today tomorrow morning each and every one of you is going to be audited by the irs  so i appreciate the courage of your convictions  you know yesterday lois lerner went before congress and yet again pleaded the fifth  and of course president obama told bill o73reilly during the super bowl there not a smidgen of corruption with the irs  it reminded me of one of my favorite movies  [adopts accent] you keep on using that word  i do not think it means what you think it means [from the princese bride]  somehow my understanding of smidgen was a little different than his
i want to thank you all for being here  you are here today at cpac because you understand the stakes in this country have never been higher  you are here because you understand our country is at a crisis point  we are at the edge of cliff  liberty is under assault  and what i want to talk to y73all about this morning is how we win
there are a lot of dc consultants that say there a choice for republicans to make  we can either choose to keep our head down to not rock the boat to not stand for anything or we can stand for principle  and they say if you stand for principle you lose elections  the way to do it the smart way the washington way is don73t stand against obamacare don73t stand against the debt ceiling don73t stand against nothing  i want to tell you something  that is a false dichotomy  you want to lose elections stand for nothing
look at the last four congressional elections  7306 08 7310 and 7312  three of the four we followed that strategy  7306 7308 and 7312  we put our head down we stood for nothing and we got walloped  the one election that was a tremendous election was 2010 when republicans drew a line in the sand  we said we stand unequivocally against obamacare against bankrupting the country and we won an historic tidal wave of an election
and then of course all of us remember president dole and president mccain and president romney  now look  those are good men they73re decent men  but when you don73t stand and draw a clear distinction when you don73t stand for principle democrats celebrate
so i73m going to stand here today and let take for an example young people  there any young people here today  i73ve got to note by the way everyone should be cheering at that  everyone is young at heart if you are at cpac by definition you are a young person because you believe in the future of america  but i want to give you an example of how we win young people and that an example of how we win elections across the board  i73m going to suggest a radical agenda to you  hope and change
you look at the last five years of president obama as hope has diminished across the world  as the people of ukraine have seen russian tanks move into their sovereign land  as the nation of israel has been left without its friend and ally the united states of america  you look at home  we have the lowest workforce participation since 1978  millions have lost hope because under president obama the american dream is harder and harder and harder for anyone to achieve  and i got to tell you change real change is changing the corrupt and broken system that is here in washington dc
how do you win young people  who are the two republicans in modern times who have most energized young people  ronald reagan and ron paul  so apparently the key is being named ronald  but if you think of it neither one of them were young rugged james dean rebel-without-a-cause  they were septuagenarians  and yet what did they do  they stood for principle  they painted a bold inspiring vision for america for how all of us can be better and young people came out by the millions and said that the vision i want to be behind  
if you were to sit down and try to design an agenda to hammer the living daylights out of young people you couldn73t do better than the obama economic agenda  under president obama we73ve had five years of the great stagnation  no economic growth  which means one generation after another coming out of school can73t find jobs  you know economists are referring to this generation of young people as a lost generation  obamacare one of the easiest ways to understand it it a massive wealth transfer from young healthy people to everybody else  and then our national debt from $10 trillion to $17 trillion  who the heck do you think going to pay for that  
the obama agenda has been horrible for young people and yet how many republicans said that  does anyone remember in the last election anyone going and making the case to young people about there is a better way a brighter future  how do we win how do we inspire young people  
number one we tell the truth  this president seems to have a little problem with that  last fall jay leno said [adopts leno voice] so uh president obama called me  he said 73jay if you like your job you can keep it73  he followed that up a couple of weeks later he said [adopts leno voice] so uh the holidays are coming up  thanksgiving  you know the first thanksgiving the pilgrims said to the indians if you like your land you can keep it  we need to tell the truth  
the truth is washington is corrupt  there is a corrupt and interlocking system of lobbyists and lawyers that are all and consultants that are suckling off washington enriching—  you are in the richest counties in the country  right now as more and more and more people are making great wealth in washington and wall street prospers and main street suffers young people suffer hispanics suffer african-americans suffer single moms suffer everyone struggling to achieve the american dream suffers  
how do we win elections  in the contrast between corrupt washington and the american people we stand with the american people  we stand with a straightforward and bold positive agenda to inspire the young to inspire women to inspire hispanics to inspire everybody
number one  defend the constitution  all of it  defend the first amendment  the right to free speech the right to a free press  for all of our friends in the media a free press means not having government monitors sitting in your newsroom  the right to freedom of religion  and that means among other things not having the irs ask citizens tell me the content of your prayers  we need to stand for the second amendment right to keep and bear arms  we need to stand for the fourth and fifth amendment rights to privacy of every american  how many of y73all have your cell phones  i73m going to ask you to please leave them on  i want to make sure president obama hears everything i have to say this morning
number two  we need to abolish the irs  we need to adopt a simple flat tax that is fair that every american can fill out his taxes on a post card
number three  we need to expand energy in this country and create high-paying jobs all over america  president obama talks about a $10 minimum wage  the real minimum wage with the lowest labor force participation since 1978 under obama is zero for the millions who have lost their jobs in the failed obama economy  i73m much more interested in—  you know in north dakota in the oil fields the average wage is $4590 an hour  i want a lot more 40- and 50- and 60-dollar an hour jobs and not zero dollar an hour unemployment
number four  we need to expand school choice  every child deserves an opportunity to have an excellent education regardless of your race your class your creed where you come from every child deserves a chance at the american dream
number five  we need to repeal dodd-frank  talk about a bill that you don73t have to read any further than the title to know nothing good can come of this  
number six  we need to audit the federal reserve  unaccountable power in washington debasing our currency driving up the cost of food and gas and the basic stuff of life is hurting americans who are struggling across this country  and i73ll tell you what else it doing  it fueling the abuse of power by petro-tyrants like putin
number seven  we need to pass a strong balanced budget amendment  we need to stop bankrupting our country  you know right now our kids and grand kids are inheriting a country where the national debt is larger than the size of our entire economy  and let me speak right now to everyone in the room who didn73t applaud when i said are there any young people here  what we73re doing to our kids and grand kids is morally wrong  it is an outrage  if we keep on this road they will spend their entire lives working not to meet the needs of the future not to meet the needs of their priorities but instead just working to pay off the debts that their deadbeat parents and grandparents stuck them with  and our parents didn73t do that to us  their parents didn73t do that to them  and the reason we are here today is we are not going to do it to the next generation we are going to turn this around
number eight  we need to repeal every single word of obamacare  when millions of americans stood up last fall and said stop this train wreck this disaster that is obamacare that is hurting millions of people the democrats said the mainstream media said—although i repeat myself—they said this is hopeless  don73t you understand  just move on  just accept it  you can73t do anything to stop this  [voice from audience yes we can]  yes we can  you know along with hope and change that pretty good
number nine  we need to stop the lawlessness  this president of the united states is the first president we73ve ever had who thinks he can choose which laws to enforce and which laws to ignore  he announces just about every day one change after another after another in obamacare  it is utterly lawless  it is inconsistent with our constitution  and it ought to trouble everyone— republicans democrats independents libertarians  let me tell you something  if you have a president who is picking and choosing which laws to follow and which laws to ignore you no longer have a president
and number ten  we need to end the corruption  we need to eliminate corporate welfare and crony capitalism  if you come to washington and serve in congress there should be a lifetime ban on lobbying  and we need to pass a strong constitutional amendment that puts into law term limits
now there are lots of voices in washington that73ll say no no no no  this is too bold  you can73t stand against the irs  that extreme  you can73t say repeal obamacare  that really a bit much let just modify it  you can73t not bankrupt the country  let just slow it down a little bit  a fried of mine suggested a bumper sticker slogan  republicans we waste less
you win elections by standing for principle and inspiring people that there is a better tomorrow  these solutions will not come from washington but i73ll tell you where they will come from which is the american people
so let me tell every one of you that took out your cell phones before let me ask you if you want to join in the army—because we73re tying to mobilize the people across this country text the word growth to the number 33733  let me give that to you again  text the word growth growth to the number 33733 because what we73re trying to do to turn this country around is mobilize and energize the american people all over this country and tweet if you73re on twitter tweet the hash tag makedclisten
i73m going to tell you in conclusion i have never been more inspired than i am right now  not inspired by washington i73m not inspired by the corruption i73m not inspired by the mendacity in the white house  i am inspired because all across this country the american people are waking up  all across this country people are waking up and saying what we73re doing is not working people are hurting tragically and we need to turn this country around  we did it in 1980 with a grassroots movement that became the reagan revolution and let me tell you the same thing is happening all over today

i am inspired i am honored to stand with you today because together if the american people continue to rise up to speak out to speak the truth we will get back to the free market principles we will get back to the constitutional liberties that have made america the greatest nation in the history of the world  we will bring back morning in america  that why we73re here and that is the future for the young and everybody else in this country  thank you and god bless you




thank you so very very much  it is great to be in a room full of patriots  we73re here in washington at a momentous time and i mean of course the sequester  in honor of the sequester for each of you who went to dinner last night your meals were reduced by 24 percent  and i can tell you i can see the looks of hunger and famine in your eyes indeed i don73t know how you73re possibly able to still stand on 976 percent of your dinner  and i73ll always be haunted by the sight of newt gingrich emaciated face  it like anne hathaway in les miserables

other than sequestration not much is happening in washington  it been pretty quiet  we did have a certain eminence gris of the republican party describe rand paul and me as wacko birds  i have to admit when rand and i first heard that we thought that was a new kind of drone but if standing for liberty and standing for the constitution makes you a wacko bird then count me a proud wacko bird  and i think there are more than a few other wacko birds gathered here today

you know i73m going to tell you the biggest surprise since coming to washington  people ask what surprised you when you got there  the biggest surprise has been frankly the defeatist attitude among so many republicans who have been in washington a long time  i cannot tell you how many times people have wanted to pat me on the head and say well that very nice you can vote no and then we73ll just lose  it is utterly maddening  

so i73m going to tell you a dirty little secret that somehow the mainstream media won73t pass on to you  for the last three weeks conservatives have been winning  

and we73re winning because of you  let me give three specific examples in the last three weeks  

a couple of weeks ago i was honored to join my friend rand paul as he stood for thirteen hours on the floor of the senate  now when rand started at 1147 in the morning there were more than a few senators republican senators who viewed what he was doing as odd and even quixotic  and he stood there alone and said we are going to stand for liberty we73re going to stand for the constitution we are going to stand until this administration acknowledges limits on its power  

earlier that day attorney general eric holder testified at a judiciary committee hearing  and i asked him straight up the question  in your judgment is it constitutional for the united states government to kill a us citizen on us soil if that individual doesn73t pose an imminent threat  his answer was he said well it wouldn73t be appropriate  and my response was general holder i73m not asking for your views on propriety  you are the chief legal advisor for the united states of america  what is your view does the department of justice have a view on whether the constitution allows our government to kill us citizens on us soil  three times he responded it wouldn73t be appropriate  it was almost as if he didn73t understand the question  and you know maybe that says something about how the left views constitutionality  in their mind appropriate and constitutional are one and the same  and so his answer i mean he really expressed frustration  i told you we73re not going to do it  don73t you trust me  and the answer is exactly that  no we don73t trust you  and we don73t trust the next guy or the next guy or the next guy whether he democrat or republican

james madison observed in the federalist papers if men were angels no government would be necessary  well there are not a whole lot of angels in washington  and thomas jefferson explained the entire purpose of the constitution is to serve as chains to bind the mischief of government

when rand stood there alone something incredible began to happen  first he received support  mike lee and i came early on to support him  then another senator  then another senator  then another senator  as the night drew on we saw one after another after another  we saw 20 house members show up on the floor of the senate  i didn73t know they knew where the senate floor was  

and something so powerful happened which is each of you engaged  it captivated the country as the american people looked at suddenly elected leaders doing something we hadn73t seen in a long time  standing for principle  now that was actually the filibuster was the first time in my life that i73ve ever spoken on the floor of the senate  and so to my grave i will owe rand paul a debt of gratitude that the first time i spoke in the senate i had the opportunity to read travis73 letter from the alamo  and it so happened that the day of the filibuster was the 177th anniversary of the fall of the alamo  so i observed to rand who i will note is a native-born texan i observed to rand that if the heroes of the alamo if william barret travis and davey crockett and jim bowie were alive today they would have been standing shoulder to shoulder with him on the floor of the senate  

i got to read from shakespeare st crispin day speech and there were more than a few senators who were not there with us that night that have held their manhoods a-cheapened as a result  i got to read the opening monologue from the great movie patton cleaned up a little bit to make it suitable for television  and i got to read president ronald reagan 1964 a time for choosing speech  as they say in the beer commercial it don73t get no better than this

but a second example is sequestration  sequestration has actually gone into effect  the white house is astonished  all of us remember the president scare-america tour where he went all over the country talking about the dramatic consequences--  you know washington dc is the only place on earth where the phrase draconian 2-percent cuts can be uttered  and you know after a while i think the president was self-parodying as he described the consequences of a 2-percent cut in a 3 12 trillion federal budget  it reminded me-- you remember the scene from ghostbusters when bill murray is talking about the end of the world cats and dogs living together  you know i halfway expected to see the stay-puff marshmallow mans come walking out  but the white house was certain republicans were going to fold under and cave and instead we stood our ground and finally got at least the first small step--and i underscore it is a small step--to reining in our uncontrollable spending and debt  

and a third example  last week we voted on an amendment that i authored to repeal funding for obamacare  now i73ll confess a couple of weeks ago when i said initially i was going to offer this amendment more than a few of my colleagues were not thrilled  and yet we saw every single republican in the senate vote unanimously to de-fund obamacare  and the democrats all stood together and voted to keep imposing the economic costs the harms as people are losing their insurance as employees are being forced to reduce their hours as insurance premiums are skyrocketing on young people every democrat voted together to maintain obamacare funding even if it pushes us into a recession  [audience interjection]  that exactly right

but something that hasn73t happened in a long time has happened  we73re winning right now  so what i want to address with you this evening at the end of this fantastic conference and boy i do sure hope one of these days ann coulter will learn to speak her mind  if we could get her to come out of that shell i just have a feeling she73d have some powerful things to say  but what i want to talk about today is the question how do we keep winning  and i73m going to suggest two very simple steps  

number one defend the constitution  and number two champion growth and opportunity  

*  *  *

defend the constitution  liberty is under assault from every direction  some of y73all may have noticed the 2nd amendment is in president obama and the senate democrats73 crosshairs right now  but we all did receive helpful advice from joe biden  that if you have any threats at home just go outside with a double-barreled shot gun and fire in the air  which is very very useful if you73re being attacked by a flock of geese or for that matter a drone  so maybe joe biden stumbled onto something after all 

but you know this past week we had a hearing in the senate judiciary committee where a senior democrat explained to me that questions about the constitution have no role in the us senate  because she explained it congress73 job to pass laws and then the supreme court interprets them and they can decide whether to throw them out or not  and you know what  that statement is exactly the problem  that statement is reminiscient of nancy pelosi when she was asked what the constitutional basis for obamacare and her answer was are you serious  are you serious  look there are a whole lot of politicians--sadly democrats and republicans in washington--who haven73t looked at the constitution in a long long time  and let me answer speaker pelosi  yes we73re serious 

the 2nd amendment provides that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed  now what part of shall not be infringed do they not understand 

but it doesn73t just end with the 2nd amendment  the 1st amendment is a big target in congress  set aside their love for regulating campaign speech because it seems every campaign elected official hates hates hates when the people dare criticize them  you know tomorrow is st patrick day  my irish mother recently reminded me that it is more than a little ironic that the national party that was the first national party to nominate the first two major party candidates to be president is today fighting a war on religious liberty  and it shows just how far we73ve gone to ask what would a john f kennedy or an al smith say to a democrat party that says to the catholic church change your religious beliefs or we73ll use our power in the federal government to shut down your charities and your hospitals  there was a time when standing for religious liberty enjoyed bipartisan support  we need to get back to that time

there the 5th amendment which provides that none of us shall be denied life without due process of law which somehow a drone from a sky hitting you in a cafe ain73t my defiinition of due process of law

there the 4th amendment that protects us from unreasonable searches and seizures  and i73ll tell you right now we need to repeal the ndaa because the federal government does not have the authority to indefinitely detain a us citizen on us soil without due process of law  

there the 10th amendment something our omnipotent federal government seems to have forgotten all about  the 10th amendment provides that the powers not given to the federal government are reserved to the states and to the people  how did we get a $165 trillion national debt  we have a federal government that thinks they have the authority to regulate our toilet seats and our light bulbs  we need to get back to the constitution

and article 6 of the constitution provides that the constitution shall be the supreme law of the land  there is an ongoing effort to undermine united states sovereignty  and i73ll tell you before i was in the senate i was the soliciter general of texas  we stood up to the world court and to the united nations  and we stood up to the president of the united states who happened to be a republican and i went before the supreme court of the united states and i said no president republican or democrat has the constitutional authority to give away us sovereignty

now we73ve seen republicans willing to stand up to republican presidents  my question to you is where were the democrats when rand and the rest of us were standing on the floor on drones

*  *  *

but the second thing we need to do is we need to champion growth and opportunity  people are hurting right now  we are in the midst of what i call the great stagnation  president obama is one of only two presidents post-world war ii to face double-digit unemployment  and for the last four years economic growth under president barack obama has averaged 08-percent  less than 1-percent  there is only one other period post-1950 where we73ve had four years of less than 1-percent economic growth  that from 1979 to 1983  coming out of jimmy carter following the same policies of out of control spending out of control debt out of control taxes out of control regulation  that the only other period  president reagan came in facing that stagnation and he implemented policies the exact opposite that of barack obama  in fact it interesting 7379 to 7383 economic growth was 08-percent  today it 08-percent for the exact same period  because obama didn73t learn the lesson from reagan that if you want to turn the economy around you cut taxes you reduce spending you reduce the debt and you don73t send regulators like locusts to destroy small businesses and jobs

do you know if president obama had followed the reagan policies and we had seen the identical growth that president reagan saw inheriting the same lousy economy barack obama did do you know that today we would have seven million additional new jobs in america  let me help make that a little more concrete  seven million new jobs is the equivalent of giving a job to every man woman and child in chicago houston philadelphia and boston  that what we73re talking about

and the stagnation under president obama doesn73t fall uniformly  listen if you so happen to be a tax lawyer or an environmental lawyer you73re doing great right now  but i73ll tell you the people who are hurting the most are those who are struggling and the least well off amongst us  under president obama hispanic unemployment climbed to 10-percent african-american unemployment to 14-percent unemployment for young people age 16 to 19 over 25-percent  that why for a long time i73ve been championing what i call opportunity conservatism which is that every republican every conservative should focus every policy on easing the means of ascent up the economic ladder  explaining how our free market system has served as the most incredible engine for opportunity for millions of people from all over the world to come with nothing and acheive anything

the policies of barack obama do not work and the people that are hurting the most are young people are african-americans are hispanics are single moms are those who are finding their opportunity shut off to reach the american dream

so we need to champion growth growth at every stage to get the economy booming  

we need to repeal obamacare  

we need to repeal dodd-frank  talk about a bill you don73t have to read any further than the title  

we need to eliminate corporate welfare  

we need to build the keystone pipeline  

we need to rein in the epa  you know in west texas the epa is trying to use a lizard to shut down oil and gas production  you know my view of lizards  they make dern fine boots  

we need to audit the fed  and we need to stop qe infinity  

we need to abolish the department of education  education is too important for it to be governed by bureaucrats in washington taking choices away from parents and kids  and we need to champion school choice the civil rights issue of the next generation  and i73d like to see more democrats going and explaining to young kids trapped in failing schools --young hispanics young african-americans--why they73re willing to consign another generation to not having a fair and equal shot at the american dream

we need to stand with israel

but we need to stop sending foreign aid to nations that hate us  just two weeks ago president obama cancelled white house tours and sent $250 million to egypt with no conditions no strings attached nothing focused on us national security--simply wrote a check

we need to get back to growth and opportunity

*  *  *

now listen spreading the message that our policies work their policies don73t that government control hurts those struggling to achieve the american dream  i can promise you something  abc nbc cbs the new york times none of them are going to help spread that message  but we have something more powerful  we have each and every one of you  the world has changed  there are no longer gatekeepers that can decide what the american people get to hear and what they don73t get to hear  

so i73m here today asking for each and every one of your help telling the story  how many of you have a cell phone on you right now  i73m going to ask you to take out your cell phone and text the word growth to the number 33733  once again that the word growth to 33733  when you do that you will be joining us in helping spread the word helping spread the word that freedom works that free market policies work that the greatest avenue for improving the condition of those struggling to achieve the american dream is limiting government and unleashing small businesses and entrepreneurs  and in fact i would ask every one of you when you get home to go to the website jobsgrowthorg  go online  we are developing a positive pro-growth economic agenda that can be a contract with america for conservatives going forward to get our economy going and to spread opportunity
and i ask for your input your help developing concrete pro-growth policies to bring americans together and to get our economy back

you know ten weeks ago i arrived in washington dc to be sworn into office  when i stood on the floor of the senate with my hand on the family bible i couldn73t help but think back to 1957  1957 my father came from cuba  he had been imprisoned he had been tortured in cuba and he came to texas with nothing--with $100 in his underwear didn73t speak a word of english  washed dishes making 50 cents an hour  as i was standing on the senate floor i couldn73t help but think if someone had come up to that 18-year old kid as he was washing dishes and suggested to him that 55 years hence his son would be sworn into office as a united states senator representing the great state of texas that would have been unimaginable  that would have been beyond anything he could possibly have conceived  and yet there was my father sitting in the gallery looking down as i took the oath of office

my dad is here today  i73d like him to stand up  i love you dad  

in our family that was a powerful powerful moment  but you know that just one small example of the incredible freedom and opportunity that this country provides  the history of the world there has been no nation on earth that has lifted so many people with nothing to prosperity  that is the legacy we are fighting for  because every one of us is here because we want to make sure that our kids and grandkids have the same prosperity the same opportunity the same liberty that we have been blessed to enjoy  we73re here because we73re not willing to give up on america  

we are facing a fundamental choice a choice that cuts across all issues  it is a choice between surrendering or standing up now to defend our liberty  

on guns do we surrender or do we stand up now

on drones do we surrender or do we stand up now

on spending do we surrender or do we stand up now

on debt do we surrender or do we stand up now

and on the constitution do we surrender or do we stand up now

that my dear friends is change we can believe in

thank you and god bless you



here a rush transcript of ted cruz portion of the speech covered on tv

let me first of all say to god be the glory tonight is a victory for the grassroots tonight is a victory for courageous conservatives across iowa and all across this great nation tonight the state of iowa has spoken iowa has sent notice that the republican nominee for the next president of the united states will not be chosen by the media will not be chosen by the washington establishment will not be chosen by the lobbyists but will be chosen by the most incredible powerful force where all sovereignty resides in our nation by we the people the american people tonight thanks to the incredible hard work of everyone gathered here of courageous conservatives across the state

to put in perspective your incredible victory that you have won tonight that is the most votes ever cast for any republican primary winner

tonight is a victory for millions of americans who have shouldered the burden of seven years of washington deals run amok tonight is a victory for every american who watched in display as career politicians in washington in both parties refuse to listen and too often fail to keep their commitments to the people tonight is a victory for every american who understands that after we survive eight long years of the obama presidency that no one personality can right the wrongs done by washington the millions who understand that it is a commitment to the constitution to our shared insistence that we rise and return to a higher standard the very standard that gave birth to the greatest nation that the world has ever known to the revolutionary understanding that all men and all women are created kwaulg that our rights do not come from the democratic party or the republican party or even from the tea party our rights come from our creator

and the federal government role the federal government responsibility is to defend those fundamental rights to defend us and while americans will continue to suffer under a president who has set an agenda who is causing millions to hurt across this country i want to remind you of the promise of scripture weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning iowa has proclaimed to the world morning is coming morning is coming from day one this campaign has been a movement for millions of americans to organize to rally to come together whatever washington says they cannot keep the people down and tonight is a testament to the people commitments to their yearnings to get back to our core commitments free market principles the judeo-christian values that built this great nation when the washington lobbyists settled on other lobbyists in this race when the media in one voice said a conservative cannot win nationwide over 800000 contributions poured in to tedcruzorg as courageous conservatives said yes we can

800000 contributions at tedcruzorg with an average contribution of $67 that is the power of the grassroots but it more than that it 12000 volunteers here in the state of iowa it over 200000 volunteers all across this great nation you know during the course of this campaign people have asked heidi and me are you tired and i will admit it is 16 18 hours a day 6 7 days a week we are not tired at all

to the contrary we are inspired by each and every one of you i leap out of bed every morning amazed that at a time when our country is in crisis every one of us has the opportunity to stand and lead that we have been put in a place of leadership for such a time as this

i’m inspired by the stories of heroism that i see every day working men like jerry dunleavy from columbus ohio who requested an entire month off his job to come to iowa to live at camp cruz and to volunteer full time when his employer refused to give him time off jerry quit his job and came anyway i love the great state of iowa 

i’m inspired by people like elliott gazer and josh hammer students at the university of chicago who spent their winter break at camp cruz but they came back this weekend and hit the phones and they hit the pavement campaigning to students across this country upon graduation rather than having mountains of debt will instead have 2 3 4 5 high-paying job offers and a chance at the american dream i’m inspired by people like alexandra a 13-year-old girl from lubbock texas who yesterday at our campaign headquarters made 823 volunteer calls

that has always been the strength of this campaign are the men and women gathered here and courageous conservatives lifting this country up in prayer each and every day and let me say our leadership team our iowa state chairman matt shultz what an extraordinary job you have done organizing a grass roots army let me say to our iowa state director brian english what an amazing job brian has done 

and to our national co-chairmen bob vander plaats and steve king these men have become dear and trusted friends they are warriors they are men of principle they stand and speak the truth they stand to defend their values and let me tell you these leaders day after day week after week have been crawling under broken glass with knives between their teeth i’m grateful for the support the early support of my friends we’re grateful for the over 150 pastors across the state of iowa who joined our team to energize people of faith we’re grateful to the state senators to the state representatives to the volunteer leaders in each of the 99 counties who stood up and said we will be heard and this will be decided by the grass roots and then i am so grateful to national leaders people like dr james dodson and tony perkins and phil robertson and governor rick perry and glenn beck leaders who have stood and led bringing together conservatives here in iowa and across the country

do you want to know what scares the washington cartel actually not remotely i don’t scare them in the tiniest bit what scares them is you what scares them is that old reagan coalition is coming back together of conservatives we’re seeing conservatives and evangelicals and libertarian and reagan democrats all coming together as one and that terrifies washington dc and so do the people of iowa heidi and i say thank you for your incredible hospitality for your love for welcoming us into your homes into your living rooms thank you for welcoming my father to preach from the pull pits of your churches and let me say to my parents mom thank you for the incredible unconditional love that you have given me every day of my life the knowledge that whatever i might do whatever i might say that my mother loves me 

to my cousin bebe like a sister to me we grew up together i love you beebs and to my dad a man who came from cuba at age 18 with nothing with $100 in his under wear he doesn’t carry money in his underwear anymore a man in prisoned tortured who washed dishes making $050 an hour who was r would live the american dream and a man who is today a pastor traveling the country preaching the gospel 

my dad is 76 years old and has the energy of a teenager and dad you have been my hero my whole life i love you daddy when the sun rises tomorrow this campaign will take the next step we will continue to campaign the same way sitting down person to person leader to leader bfw halls dunkin donuts returning to the great state of new hampshire and let me speak for a minute to the men and women of the state of new hampshire 36 years ago you welcomed to the granite state a candidate running for president who was also deeply disliked by the washington establishment and the washington cartel a candidate dismissed out right by the media some polls had him 15 20 behind you refused to let the establishment and media do your thinking for you you refused to let them tell you how to vote you wanted a candidate who didn’t adopt his position because of the latest opinion polls but because of a deep and under lying conservative philosophy that grounded him so that he knew exactly what he believed and the principles were that built this great nation and so tonight i want to say to the people of new hampshire thank you for what you did 36 years ago thank you for giving america and the world and history our 40th president of the united states ronald wilson reagan and i ask the people of new hampshire and the people of south carolina and the people of nevada and the people of the super tuesday states on march 1 to each of you do not listen to our words do not listen to the rhetoric from campaigns but rather hold everyone of us accountable hold me accountable and every other candidate accountable to be a consistent conservative 

if you want a candidate to repeal obamacare then support a candidate who has led the fight to repeal obamacare if you want a president to stop amnesty to secure the borders and keep us safe then support a candidate who has led the fight to stop amnesty to secure the borders and to keep us safe if you want a candidate to support life and marriage and religious liberty then support a candidate who spent decades of his life fighting to defend life and marriage and religious liberty if you want a candidate to defend the second amendment right to keep and bear arms then ask of every candidate where were you in the spring of 2013 when barack obama and harry reid and chuck schumer tried to undermine the second amendment right to keep and bear arms if you want a candidate who will stand unapologetically with the nation of israel then support a candidate who has led the fight over and over again to stand by our friend and ally the nation of israel and if you want a commander in chief who will fulfill the most solemn obligation of the president to keep this nation safe then support a candidate who has demonstrated the commitment the judgment the experience the clarity of vision to identify our enemy to call it by its name radical islamic terrorism and to utterly and completely defeat isis if i am elected president every militant on the face of the planet know if you go and join isis if you wage jihad on the united states of america if you attempt to murder innocent americans you are signing your death warrant

and i’ll tell you this if the other states across the country follow the lead of the good men and women of iowa and support this campaign then i tell you this this july in cleveland you will hear these words spoken from the podium of the unified republican convention tonight i want to say to every member of the democratic party who believes in limited government in personal opportunity and the united states constitution and a safe and secure america come home to the reagan democrats your party has left you and the republican party wants you we welcome you back

because together this year republicans and the reagan democrats can send an unmistakable message the message of a reagan like landslide that will drive the liberal elite and the washington cartel into the potomac and out to sea never to be seen again together we can bring out a new era of economic growth of military strength of international security and the future of hope that our children deserve if we commit to do more than hope if we aspire to govern by a higher standard that transcends political party and race and gender and income and to everyone that is tired of a president that divides us daily on racial lines and religious lines on gender lines on socioeconomic lines we will have a president that once again seeks to bring us together and unite us on our shared values of who we are as americans the most solemn responsibility of the president is to keep this country safe and we will stop the weakness and april — do what it takes to defeat them i give you my solemn promise we will finally finally finally secure the borders and and sanctuary cities

and i want to speak for a moment to the soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and moms and dads who have a child serving overseas and husbands and wives wake up wondering if their loved one is still alive waiting months upon months to get a hug from mommy a kiss from mommy the men and women sent into combat with arms tied behind their back with no idea when it will end in january 17 you will have a commander in chief who finally has your back and to the police officers and the firemen and the first responders the heros who rushed in to burning buildings instead of out of burning buildings the last seven years of having a president having an attorney general that demonizes you that vilifies you that sides with the criminals land looters instead of the brave men and women of law enforcement that will end on january 20 2017 so tonight the state of iowa the democrats here seem to be in a virtual tie between one candidate who admits he a socialist and the other candidate who pretends she not i wish them both luck 

but i will tell you this as margaret thatcher observed the problem with socialism is that you run out of other peoples’ money and let me tell you tonight…


thank you so very much carly for your incredible friendship and leadership god bless new york and god bless the commonwealth of pennsylvania
i am so excited to share with you what america has learned over the past few months
and it has nothing to do with a politician tonight winning his home state
it has everything to do with what we’ve seen in the towns and faces that have been weathered with trouble joblessness and fear it is what we learned looking at the factories that have been shuttered and the hearts that are closing
we have learned that america is at a point of choosing
the media will say it is about choosing a president
but it really isn’t
our real choice is personal and every generation must make the same choice
will we continue to live in the past with what we know no longer works or will we move forward to a new and better place
the people in state after state have made it clear they cry out for a new path
this is the year of the outsider
i am an outsider bernie sanders is an outsider
both with the same diagnosis but both with very different paths to healing
millions of americans have chosen one of these outsiders our campaigns don’t find our fuel in bundlers and special interests but rather directly from the people the wide-eyed youth of any age that haven’t given up on the hope that tomorrow can and will be better
ronald reagan and jack kennedy were outsiders
they both represented a whole new vision and vibrancy
a new generation of ideas
jack kennedy looked forward instead of back to the first half century of world war
he knew that america could dream and build if we were set free
not tanks for war but rockets for exploration
reagan looked out – to us – the most powerful force for innovation that the world has ever known
there we found the new tech pioneers like bill gates and a young steve jobs they had vision and the freedom to build a new world that that at the time only they saw and because they were free they challenged the way and changed the way all of us live work and interact

now it is our turn
this generation must first look inward to see who we really are after years of being beaten down
years of being told we couldn’t shouldn’t or wouldn’t
this generation needs to answer a new set of questions
can we should we will we
are we still those people
those dreamers and doers
are america greatest generations in our past
or are our best days yet ahead
we must unite the republican party because doing so is the first step toward uniting all americans

the question is not whether all americans can or will agree on a majority of issues all of the time the question is whether a majority of americans are hungry to rally around a set of principles larger than any single issue that a politician may use to divide us

tonight i’m speaking to you from philadelphia it natural when we talk about our nation earliest days that we focus our attention on the declaration of independence and the constitution and we can learn a great deal about a path forward by focusing on the passionate disputes and disagreements among our founding fathers — differences that were put aside only because of the weight and consequence of the foundational principles they sought to proclaim and the price to be paid if they failed to rise to the task
today as republicans we agree on a lot and sure areas of lesser agreement exist as well but on the fundamental question are we satisfied with the current direction of our country we speak with one voice
i call on you as jfk did in the 60
and as reagan did in the 80
to chart a new american journey forward
one that isn’t led by me or anyone in washington but by you
and millions of others just like you
one where we still have differences yet we choose to concentrate on what we have in common
one that lifts others up and believes in the rights responsibilities goodness and strength of all mankind
we have so much that binds us together our families our work ethic our ability to dream and build unlike any people in history but most of all our charity our love for our fellow men and women and our willingness to sacrifice for those in need
let us unite on the things that have always made us great
we are great because we are good
because over and over again we have chosen courage in the moments of crisis freedom in the face of compromise and hope in the face of challenges that everyone told us could not be overcome
our sitting president ran on a slogan that should have been a great first step…
it promised us yes we can
now is the time to take that slogan and put it into action
yes we can was a recognition of the hope that we can and should recover the problem was that barack obama prescriptions only led to more elitist control from washington less freedom for the people
but now is the time as americans to once again reclaim that hope
to take another giant leap for mankind
to speak the words with all the power and might that we can muster and use the words that have changed the world time and again
the words that the slaves yearned to hear from the american people and abraham lincoln when they cried out for freedom
the words that europe and britain heard when they cried out for help defeating totalitarian evil in the 1940
the words that led two men in north carolina to be the first in flight
and half a century later the first man to reach the moon
and decades later two men in their garage to come up with apple
they are the words that will repair our tattered spirit lift up our economy and those who are barely making it they are the words that will vanquish the evil of isis and return the rule of law
they are the words that when americans come together and say with conviction – they change the world
they are the vision of this campaign
not yes we can but now yes we will
we will restore our spirit
we will free our minds and imagination
we will create a new and better world
we will bring back jobs freedom and security
we will find new ways to ignite an energy revolution with more jobs and greater choices
we will defeat the evil of islamists and isis
we will live as neighbors friends and family in peace once again
we will heal the sick feed the poor and defend the defenseless
we will restore our rightful place in the world
we will do what americans do best
we will live for others – we will change the world through the hope of freedom enduring promise and our unrelenting spirit
you can be empowered and in a digital age it is all the easier for your voice to be heard your choices to govern your work your education your future if only washington will get out of the way
join me on this journey of less talk and more action because i know you you may have been knocked down but america has always been best when she is lying down with her back on the mat and the crowd has given the final count it is time for us to get up shake it off and be who we were destined to be
don’t let anyone try to convince you otherwise
here is the truth you don’t need me or any politician
but we do need each other all of us coming together as one as we the people because not only do we say – yes we can beginning here and now we pledge to each and every one of us yes we will
and now my friends onward to victory
